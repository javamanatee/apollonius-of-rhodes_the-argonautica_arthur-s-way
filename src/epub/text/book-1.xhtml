			<h3 class="nobreak" id="book1">THE FIRST BOOK</h3>
			<p class="i0"><span class="sc">First</span> in my song shalt thou be, O Phœbus, the song that I sing</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the heroes of old, who sped, at the hest of Pelias the king,</p>
			<p class="i0">When down through the gorge of the Pontus-sea, through the Crags Dark-blue,</p>
			<p class="i0">On the Quest of the Fleece of Gold the strong-ribbed Argo flew.</p>
			<p class="i1">For an oracle came unto Pelias, how that in days to be</p>
			<p class="i0">A terrible doom should be dealt him of him whom his eyes should see</p>
			<p class="i0">From the field coming in, with the one foot only sandal-shod.</p>
			<p class="i0">Nor long thereafter did Jason fulfil the word of the God:</p>
			<p class="i0">For in wading the rush of Amaurus swollen with winter-tide rain</p>
			<p class="i0">One sandal plucked he forth of the mire, but the one was he fain</p>
			<p class="i0">To leave in the depths, for the swirl of the waters to sweep to the main.</p>
			<p class="i0">Straightway to the presence of Pelias he came, and his hap was to light</p>
			<p class="i0">On a banquet, the which unto Father Poseidon the king had dight,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the rest of the Gods, but Pelasgian Hêrê he heeded not.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the king beheld him, and straightway laid for his life the plot,</p>
			<p class="i0">And devised for him toil of a troublous voyage, that lost in the sea,</p>
			<p class="i0">Or lost amid alien men his home-return might be.</p>
			<p class="i1">Of the ship and her fashioning, bards of the olden time have told</p>
			<p class="i0">How Argus wrought, how Athênê made him cunning-souled.</p>
			<p class="i0">But now be it mine the lineage and names of her heroes to say,</p>
			<p class="i0">And to tell of the long sea-paths whereover they needs must stray,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the deeds that they wrought:⁠—may the Muses vouchsafe to inspire the lay.</p>
			<p class="i1">Of Orpheus first will I sing, of the child that Calliopê bare,</p>
			<p class="i0">As telleth the tale, for she loved Oeagrus, Thracia’s heir.</p>
			<p class="i0">By the peak Pimplean was born the Song-queen’s wondrous child;</p>
			<p class="i0">For they tell how he charmed by the voice of his song on the mountains wild</p>
			<p class="i0">The stubborn rocks into life, made rivers their flowing refrain,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the wildwood oaks this day be memorials of that weird strain;</p>
			<p class="i0">For they burgeon and bloom by Zonê yet on the Thracian shore,</p>
			<p class="i0">Ranked orderly line upon line, the selfsame trees which of yore,</p>
			<p class="i0">Spell-drawn by his lyre, from Pieria followed the minstrel on.</p>
			<p class="i0">Such an one was the Orpheus that Aison’s son for a helper won</p>
			<p class="i0">For his high emprise, when he followed the pointing of Cheiron’s hand⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Orpheus, who ruled o’er the Bistonid folk in Pieria-land.</p>
			<p class="i1">And swiftly Asterion came, whom Komêtês begat by the side</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Apidanus, there where his seaward-swirling waters glide;</p>
			<p class="i0">In Peiresiae he dwelt, anigh to Phyllêion’s leafy crest.</p>
			<p class="i0">Mighty Apidanus, sacred Enipeus, have thitherward pressed</p>
			<p class="i0">To mingle the waters, far-severed that rise from the earth’s deep breast.</p>
			<p class="i1">Polyphemus forsook Larissa, and unto Jason he sought;</p>
			<p class="i0">Eilatus’ son: in his youth mid the Lapithan heroes he fought.</p>
			<p class="i0">When the Lapithans armed them for fight, when the Centaur host they quelled,</p>
			<p class="i0">Their youngest he was; but now were his limbs sore burdened with eld.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet even as of old his heart with the spirit of battle swelled.</p>
			<p class="i1">Nor in Phylakê Iphiklus tarried to waste an inglorious life,</p>
			<p class="i0">Uncle of Aison’s child, for that Aison had taken to wife</p>
			<p class="i0">His sister the Phylakid maiden Alkimêdê: wherefore strong</p>
			<p class="i0">Was the love of his kin to constrain him to join that hero-throng.</p>
			<p class="i1">Neither Admêtus in Pherae, the goodly land of sheep,</p>
			<p class="i0">In his palace would tarry beneath Chalkodon’s mountain-steep.</p>
			<p class="i1">Neither in Alopê tarried Echion and Erytus, sons</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Hermes, wealthy in corn-land, crafty-hearted ones.</p>
			<p class="i0">And their kinsman, the third with these, came forth, on the Quest as they hied,</p>
			<p class="i0">Aithalides: where the streams of Amphrysus softly slide,</p>
			<p class="i0">Him Eupolemeia the Phthian, Myrmidon’s daughter, bare,</p>
			<p class="i0">But offspring of Antianeira the Menetid those twain were.</p>
			<p class="i1">Came thither Korônus, forsaking Gyrton the wealthy town:</p>
			<p class="i0">Right valiant was Kaineus’ son, yet he passed not his father’s renown.</p>
			<p class="i0">For of Kaineus the poets have sung, how smitten of Centaurs he died,</p>
			<p class="i0">Who could not be slain, when alone in his prowess, with none beside,</p>
			<p class="i0">He drave them before him in rout, but they rallied, and charged afresh,</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet availed not their fury to thrust him aback, nor to pierce his flesh;</p>
			<p class="i0">But unconquered, unflinching, down to the underworld he passed,</p>
			<p class="i0">Battered from life by the storm of the massy pines that they cast.</p>
			<p class="i1">And came Titaresian Mopsus withal, unto whom was given</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Lêto’s son above all men the lore of the birds of the heaven.</p>
			<p class="i0">And there was Eurydamas, Ktimenus’ son, which dwelt in the land</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Dolopian folk: by the Xynian mere did his palace stand.</p>
			<p class="i1">And from Opus Menoitius fared at Aktor his father’s behest</p>
			<p class="i0">To the end he might go with the chieftains of men on the glorious Quest.</p>
			<p class="i1">And Eurytion hath followed with these; Eribôtes the mighty is gone,</p>
			<p class="i0">This, Teleon’s scion, and that, of Irus, Aktor’s son;</p>
			<p class="i0">For in sooth it was Teleon begat Eribôtes the glory-crowned,</p>
			<p class="i0">And Irus, Eurytion. With these was a third, Oïleus, found,</p>
			<p class="i0">Peerless in manhood, exceeding cunning to follow the flight</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the foe, when the reeling battalions were shattered before his might.</p>
			<p class="i1">Came the son of Kanêthus the scion of Abas; with eager speed</p>
			<p class="i0">Came Kanthus forth of Eubœa: it was not fate-decreed</p>
			<p class="i0">That again he should turn and behold Kerinthus, for doomed was he,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even he and Mopsus withal, the wise in augury,</p>
			<p class="i0">To perish in Libya, lost in the waste of a wide sand-sea.</p>
			<p class="i0">Sooth, never was mischief removed too far to be found of the doomed;</p>
			<p class="i0">Forasmuch as in Libya’s desert were even these entombed,</p>
			<p class="i0">As far from the Kolchian land as the space outstretched between</p>
			<p class="i0">The sun’s uprising, and where the setting thereof is seen.</p>
			<p class="i1">And Klytius and Iphitus gathered to that great mustering,</p>
			<p class="i0">Oichalia’s warders, children of Eurytus, ruthless king,</p>
			<p class="i0">Who received of Far-smiter a bow; but he had no profit thereof,</p>
			<p class="i0">For in archery-skill with the giver’s self he wantonly strove.</p>
			<p class="i1">And with these fared Aiakus’ sons, yet not from the selfsame place,</p>
			<p class="i0">Nor together, for far had they wandered away from the home of their race,</p>
			<p class="i0">Aegina, what time in their folly the blood of their brother they spilt,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even Phokus: to Salamis Telamon bare his burden of guilt:</p>
			<p class="i0">But Peleus roved till in Phthia the halls of the outcast he built.</p>
			<p class="i1">And with these from Kekropia Boutes, a lord of battle-fame,</p>
			<p class="i0">Stout Teleon’s son, and Phalêrus the mighty spearman came.</p>
			<p class="i0">It was Alkon his father that sent him forth: no sons save him</p>
			<p class="i0">Had the ancient to cherish his age and his light of life grown dim:</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet, albeit his only-begotten he was, and the last of his line,</p>
			<p class="i0">He sent him, that so amidst valour of heroes his prowess should shine.</p>
			<p class="i0">But Theseus, of all the sons of Erechtheus most renowned,</p>
			<p class="i0">At Tainarum under the earth by an unseen fetter was bound.</p>
			<p class="i0">For he trod the Path of Fear with Peirithoüs; else that Quest</p>
			<p class="i0">By the might of these had been lightlier compassed of all the rest.</p>
			<p class="i1">And Tiphys, Hagnias’ son, hath forsaken the Thespians that dwell</p>
			<p class="i0">In the city of Siphas: of all men keenest was he to foretell</p>
			<p class="i0">The wrath of the waves on the broad sea, keen to foreknow from afar</p>
			<p class="i0">The blasts of the storm, and to guide the galley by sun and by star.</p>
			<p class="i0">’Twas Athênê Tritonis herself that made him eager-souled</p>
			<p class="i0">To join that muster of heroes that longed his face to behold;</p>
			<p class="i0">For she fashioned the sea-swift ship, and Argus but wrought as she planned,</p>
			<p class="i0">Arestor’s son, for the Goddess’s counsels guided his hand:</p>
			<p class="i0">Therefore amongst all ships unmatched was the ship that he made,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even all that with swinging oars the paths of the sea have essayed.</p>
			<p class="i1">Came Phlias withal from Araithyriae to essay the Quest,</p>
			<p class="i0">From a wealthy home, for the toil of his hands had the Wine-god blessed,</p>
			<p class="i0">His father, where welleth Asôpus up from the green hill’s breast.</p>
			<p class="i1">From Argos did sons of Bias, Arêius and Talaus, come,</p>
			<p class="i0">And mighty Laodokus, fruit of Nêleus’ daughter’s womb,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even Pero, for whose sake Aiolus’ scion Melampus bore</p>
			<p class="i0">In Iphiklus’ steading affliction of bonds exceeding sore.</p>
			<p class="i1">Nor yet did the prowess of mighty-hearted Herakles fail</p>
			<p class="i0">The longing of Aison’s son for his helping, as telleth the tale.</p>
			<p class="i0">But as soon as the flying rumour of gathering heroes he heard,</p>
			<p class="i0">He turned from the track that he trod from Arcadia Argos-ward,</p>
			<p class="i0">On the path that he paced as he bare that boar alive from the glen</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Lampeia, wherein he had battened, the vast Erymanthian fen.</p>
			<p class="i0">At the entering-in of Mycenae’s market-stead he cast</p>
			<p class="i0">From his mighty shoulders the beast, as he writhed in his bonds knit fast:</p>
			<p class="i0">But himself of his own will, thrusting Eurystheus’ purpose aside,</p>
			<p class="i0">Hasted away; and Hylas, his henchman true and tried,</p>
			<p class="i0">Which bare his arrows and warded his bow, with the hero hath hied.</p>
			<p class="i1">Therewithal hath the scion of god-descended Danaus gone,</p>
			<p class="i0">Nauplius, born unto King Klytonêus, Naubolus’ son;</p>
			<p class="i0">And of Lernus Naubolus sprang; and Lernus, as bards have told,</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Proitus, Nauplius’ son; and unto Poseidon of old</p>
			<p class="i0">Amymônê, Danaus’ daughter, who couched in the God’s embrace,</p>
			<p class="i0">Bare Nauplius, chief in the seafarer’s craft of the Earth-born race.</p>
			<p class="i1">Last cometh Idmon the seer, of all that in Argos dwell,</p>
			<p class="i0">Cometh knowing the doom he hath heard the birds of heaven foretell,</p>
			<p class="i0">Lest the people should haply begrudge him a hero’s glorious fame:</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet not of the very loins of Abas the doomed seer came;</p>
			<p class="i0">But the son of Lêto begat him to share the noble name</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Aetolia’s sons, and in prophecy-lore he made him wise,</p>
			<p class="i0">And in signs of the fowl of the heaven and tokens ’mid flame that rise.</p>
			<p class="i1">Polydeukes the strong did Aetolia’s Princess Leda speed</p>
			<p class="i0">From Sparta, and Kastor cunning to rein the fleetfoot steed.</p>
			<p class="i0">These twain in Tyndareus’ palace, her dearly-beloved, her pride,</p>
			<p class="i0">That lady at one birth bare; howbeit she nowise denied</p>
			<p class="i0">Their prayer to depart, for her spirit was worthy of Zeus’ bride.</p>
			<p class="i1">Apharetus’ children, Lynkeus and Idas the arrogant-souled,</p>
			<p class="i0">From Arênê went forth: in their prowess exceeding were these overbold,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even both; but Lynkeus for eyes of keenest ken was renowned,</p>
			<p class="i0">If in sooth that story be true, that, though one lay underground,</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet lightly of Lynkeus’ eyes should the gloom-swathed corpse be found.</p>
			<p class="i1">And with these Periklymenus Neleus’ son was enkindled to fare,</p>
			<p class="i0">Eldest of all the sons that the Lady of Pylos bare</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto Neleus the godlike; and might unmeasured Poseidon gave</p>
			<p class="i0">To the prince, and a boon moreover, that whatso shape he should crave,</p>
			<p class="i0">That, as he fought in the shock of the meeting ranks, he should have.</p>
			<p class="i1">From Arcadia Amphidamas and Kepheus came for the Quest,</p>
			<p class="i0">Who were dwellers in Tegea-town, and the land that Apheidas possessed,</p>
			<p class="i0">Two scions of Aleus; yea and a third followed even as they went,</p>
			<p class="i0">Ankaius: Lykurgus his father was minded the lad to have sent,</p>
			<p class="i0">Being elder brother to these, but himself was constrained to stay</p>
			<p class="i0">In the city with Aleus, tending the dear head silver-grey.</p>
			<p class="i0">Howbeit in charge to his brethren twain he gave the lad.</p>
			<p class="i0">So he went, and the fell of a bear Maenalian for buckler he had,</p>
			<p class="i0">And a battle-axe huge his right hand swung; for his armour of fight</p>
			<p class="i0">Had his old grandsire in a secret chamber hidden from sight,</p>
			<p class="i0">If haply so he might cripple the wings of the eagle’s flight.</p>
			<p class="i1">Fared thither Augeias; they named him in songs of the olden day</p>
			<p class="i0">The Sun-god’s child, and the hero in Elis-land bare sway</p>
			<p class="i0">In pride of his wealth: but he longed to behold the Kolchian coast,</p>
			<p class="i0">And to look upon mighty Aiêtes the lord of the Kolchian host.</p>
			<p class="i1">Asterius came, and Amphion, the sons that a fair queen bore,</p>
			<p class="i0">When Pellênê’s king Hyperasius dwelt in the city of yore</p>
			<p class="i0">By Pelles their grandsire built ’neath the cliffs of Achaia’s shore.</p>
			<p class="i1">Euphêmus from Tainarus came to be joined to their company,</p>
			<p class="i0">Europê’s child; and the swiftest of all men on Earth was he:</p>
			<p class="i0">For the daughter of Tityos the giant couched in Poseidon’s embrace;</p>
			<p class="i0">And this their son would run o’er the grey sea’s weltering face,</p>
			<p class="i0">Neither sank in the surge his fast-flying steps, but, with footsole alone</p>
			<p class="i0">Bedewed with the spray, on his watery path was he wafted on.</p>
			<p class="i1">Sons of Poseidon beside him withal two other came,</p>
			<p class="i0">One leaving Miletus afar, the city of haughty fame,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even Erginus, and one from Imbrasian Hêrê’s fane</p>
			<p class="i0">Parthenia, Ankaius the mighty; and men of renown were the twain</p>
			<p class="i0">In the craft of the sea, and withal in the toil of the battle-strain.</p>
			<p class="i1">Hasting from Kalydon Oineus’ son to their muster hath hied,</p>
			<p class="i0">Meleager the stalwart; and there was Laocoön still at his side,</p>
			<p class="i0">Brother to Oineus; but not of the selfsame womb were they,</p>
			<p class="i0">For a handmaid bare him; and him, though flecked was his hair with grey,</p>
			<p class="i0">For guide and for guard to his son hath Oineus the old king sent.</p>
			<p class="i0">So it fell that a beardless lad to the valorous gathering went</p>
			<p class="i0">Of heroes; yet no man of all that came had the deeds outdone</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the lad, save Herakles, if that he might but have tarried on</p>
			<p class="i0">One year mid Aetolia’s sons, till he grew to his strength, I ween.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, and his mother’s brother, a javelin-hurler keen,</p>
			<p class="i0">And a warrior tried, when foot is set against foot in the fray,</p>
			<p class="i0">Iphiklus, Thestius’ scion, trod the selfsame way.</p>
			<p class="i1">Came Palaimonius, whose grandsire was Olenius, and his sire</p>
			<p class="i0">Lernus in name; but in birth was he child of the Lord of Fire:</p>
			<p class="i0">Wherefore he halted in either foot; but his bodily frame</p>
			<p class="i0">And his prowess might no man contemn, for which cause also his name</p>
			<p class="i0">Was found with the mighty who won for Jason deathless fame.</p>
			<p class="i1">Came Iphitus, Ornytus’ son, from Phokis withal for the Quest,</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Naubolus’ line: in the days overpast was Jason his guest,</p>
			<p class="i0">What time unto Pytho he fared to inquire of the high Gods’ doom</p>
			<p class="i0">Touching the Quest; for he welcomed him then in his mountain home.</p>
			<p class="i1">And Zetes and Kalais withal, the North-wind’s children, were there,</p>
			<p class="i0">Whom Oreithyia, Erechtheus’ daughter, to Boreas bare</p>
			<p class="i0">In the uttermost part of wintry Thrace; for the God swooped down,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the Thracian North-wind snatched her away from Kekrops’ town,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even as she whirled in the dance on the lawn by Ilissus’ flow.</p>
			<p class="i0">And he brought her afar to the place where standeth the crag men know</p>
			<p class="i0">For the Rock of Sarpedon, whereby doth Erginus the river glide:</p>
			<p class="i0">And he shrouded her round with viewless clouds, and he made her his bride.</p>
			<p class="i0">And lo, on the ankles of these did quivering pinions unfold,</p>
			<p class="i0">Strong wings, as in air they upleapt, a marvel great to behold,</p>
			<p class="i0">Gleaming with golden scales; and about their shoulders strayed,</p>
			<p class="i0">Down-streaming from neck and from head in the glory of youth arrayed,</p>
			<p class="i0">Dark tresses that tossed in the rushing breezes amidst them that played.</p>
			<p class="i1">Yea, and Akastus, his own son, had no will to abide</p>
			<p class="i0">That day with his mighty sire in the halls of Pelias’ pride.</p>
			<p class="i0">Nor would Argus be left, who had wrought as Athênê guided his hand;</p>
			<p class="i0">But these twain needs must be numbered too with the glorious band.</p>
			<p class="i1">This is the tale of the helpers with Aison’s son that were found:</p>
			<p class="i0">These be the men whom the folk, even all which dwelt around,</p>
			<p class="i0">Called ever the Minyan Chiefs: for of those that went on the Quest</p>
			<p class="i0">Born of the daughters of Minyas’ blood were the most and the best.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, she which had borne this Jason to emprise perilous-wild,</p>
			<p class="i0">Alkimedê, also was daughter of Klymenê, Minyas’ child.</p>
			<p class="i1">Now when all things ready were made by the hands of many a thrall,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even whatso the galley for sea ready-dight should be furnished withal,</p>
			<p class="i0">When traffic lureth the shipmen afar to an alien land,</p>
			<p class="i0">Then through the city they passed to their ship, where she lay on the strand</p>
			<p class="i0">Which is called Magnesian Pagasae. Ever, as onward they strode,</p>
			<p class="i0">To right and to left a mingled multitude ran: but they showed</p>
			<p class="i0">Radiant amidst them as stars amid clouds; and some ’gan cry,</p>
			<p class="i0">As they gazed on the glorious forms that in harness of war swept by:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘What is in Pelias’ thoughts, King Zeus, that so goodly a band</p>
			<p class="i0">Of heroes is hurled by him forth of the Panachaian land?</p>
			<p class="i0">In the day of their coming with ravening fire the halls shall they fill</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Aiêtes, except he shall yield them the Fleece of his own good will.</p>
			<p class="i0">But a long way lieth between, unaccomplished yet is the toil.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake they on this side and that through the city: the women the while,</p>
			<p class="i0">Heavenward uplifting their hands, to the Gods that abide for aye</p>
			<p class="i0">Made vehement prayer for the heart’s delight of the homecoming day.</p>
			<p class="i0">And one to another made answer, and moaned, as her tears fell fast:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Hapless Alkimedê, thee too evil hath found at the last;</p>
			<p class="i0">Nor to thee was vouchsafed amid bliss to the end of thy days to attain!</p>
			<p class="i0">Woe’s me for Aison the ill-starred!⁠—verily this had been gain</p>
			<p class="i0">For him, if rolled in his shroud before this woeful day,</p>
			<p class="i0">Deep under Earth, with the cup of affliction untasted, he lay:</p>
			<p class="i0">And O that the darkling surge, when Hellê the maiden died,</p>
			<p class="i0">Had whelmed down Phrixus too with the ram!⁠—but a man’s voice cried</p>
			<p class="i0">From the throat of the monster, the portent accurst, that so it might doom</p>
			<p class="i0">For Alkimedê sorrow and griefs untold in the days to come.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So ’mid the moan of the women marched the heroes along.</p>
			<p class="i0">And by this were the thralls and the handmaids gathered in one great throng.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then fell on his neck his mother, and sharply the anguish-thorn</p>
			<p class="i0">Pierced each soft breast, the while his father, the eld-forlorn,</p>
			<p class="i0">Close-swathed as a corpse on his bed, lay groaning and groaning again.</p>
			<p class="i0">But the hero essayed to hush their laments and assuage their pain</p>
			<p class="i0">With words of cheer, and he spake, ‘Take up my war-array,’</p>
			<p class="i0">To the thralls, and with downcast eyes did these in silence obey.</p>
			<p class="i0">But his mother, as round her child her arms at the first she had flung,</p>
			<p class="i0">So clave she, and wept without stint: as the motherless maiden she clung,</p>
			<p class="i0">Whose forlorn little arms clasp fondly her grey old nurse, when the tide</p>
			<p class="i0">Cometh up of her woe:⁠—she hath no one to love her nor comfort beside;</p>
			<p class="i0">And a weary lot is hers ’neath a stepdame’s tyrannous sway,</p>
			<p class="i0">Who with bitter revilings evil-entreateth her youth alway:</p>
			<p class="i0">And her heart as she waileth is cramped as by chains in her frenzied despair,</p>
			<p class="i0">That she cannot sob forth the anguish that struggleth for utterance there:</p>
			<p class="i0">So stintlessly wept Alkimedê, so in her arms did she strain</p>
			<p class="i0">Her son; and she cried from the depths of her love and her yearning pain:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Oh, that on that same day when I, the affliction-oppressed,</p>
			<p class="i0">Hearkened the voice of Pelias the king, and his evil behest,</p>
			<p class="i0">I had yielded up the ghost, and forgotten to mourn and to weep,</p>
			<p class="i0">That thyself, that thine own dear hands, in the grave might have laid me to sleep,</p>
			<p class="i0">O my beloved!⁠—for this was the one wish unfulfilled:</p>
			<p class="i0">But with other thy nursing-dues long had mine heart in contentment been stilled.</p>
			<p class="i0">And I, of Achaia’s daughters the envied in days that are gone,</p>
			<p class="i0">Like a bondwoman now in tenantless halls shall be left alone,</p>
			<p class="i0">Pining, a hapless mother, in yearning for thee, my pride</p>
			<p class="i0">And exceeding delight in the days overpast, for whom I untied</p>
			<p class="i0">For the first time and last my zone; for to me beyond others the doom</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the stern Birth-goddess begrudged abundant fruit of the womb.</p>
			<p class="i0">Ah me for my blindness of heart!⁠—not once, not in dreams, might I see</p>
			<p class="i0">The vision of Phrixus’ deliverance turned to a curse for me!’</p>
			<p class="i1">So mourned she, and ever she moaned amidst of her speech, and thereby</p>
			<p class="i0">Stood her handmaids, and echoed her wail, an exceeding bitter cry.</p>
			<p class="i0">But the hero with gentle words for her comfort made answer, and spake:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Fill me not thus overmeasure with anguish of soul for thy sake,</p>
			<p class="i0">Mother mine, forasmuch as from evil thou shalt not redeem me so</p>
			<p class="i0">By thy tears, but shalt add the rather woe unto weight of woe.</p>
			<p class="i0">For the Gods mete out unto mortals afflictions unforeseen:</p>
			<p class="i0">Wherefore be strong to endure their doom, though thine anguish be keen.</p>
			<p class="i0">Take comfort to think that Athênê hereunto our courage hath stirred:</p>
			<p class="i0">Remember the oracles: call to remembrance how good was the word</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Phœbus: be glad for this hero-array for mine help that is come.</p>
			<p class="i0">Now, mother, do thou with thine handmaids in quiet abide in thine home,</p>
			<p class="i0">Neither be as a bird ill-omened to bode my ship ill-speed;</p>
			<p class="i0">And escort of clansmen and thralls thy son to the galley shall lead.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake he, and turned him, and forth of his halls his way hath he ta’en.</p>
			<p class="i0">And as goeth Apollo forth of his incense-bearing fane,</p>
			<p class="i0">Through Delos the hallowed, or Klaros, or Pytho the place of his shrine,</p>
			<p class="i0">Or Lycia the wide, where the waters of Xanthus ripple and shine,</p>
			<p class="i0">So seemed he, as onward he pressed through the throng, and a loud acclaim</p>
			<p class="i0">Of their mingled cheering arose. And there met him an ancient dame,</p>
			<p class="i0">Iphias, priestess of Artemis warder of tower and wall.</p>
			<p class="i0">At his right hand caught she, and kissed it, but spake no word at all,</p>
			<p class="i0">For she could not, how fain soe’er, so pressed the multitude on;</p>
			<p class="i0">And she drifted away to the fringe of the crowd, and was left alone,</p>
			<p class="i0">As the old be left by the young: and he passed on afar, and was gone.</p>
			<p class="i1">So when he had left the streets of the city builded fair,</p>
			<p class="i0">To the beach Pagasaean he came, and his comrades hailed him there</p>
			<p class="i0">In a throng abiding beside the Argo ship as she lay</p>
			<p class="i0">By the river’s mouth, and overagainst her gathered they.</p>
			<p class="i0">And they looked, and behold, Adrastus and Argus hasting amain</p>
			<p class="i0">Thitherward from the city, and sorely they marvelled, beholding the twain</p>
			<p class="i0">Despite the purpose of Pelias thitherward hurrying fast.</p>
			<p class="i0">On his shoulders a bull’s hide Argus the son of Arestor had cast,</p>
			<p class="i0">Great, dark with the fell; but the prince in a mantle fair was arrayed,</p>
			<p class="i0">Twofold: Pelopeia his sister the gift in his hand had laid.</p>
			<p class="i0">Howbeit Jason forbare to ask them of this or of that;</p>
			<p class="i0">But he bade them for council sit them down where the others sat.</p>
			<p class="i0">So there upon folded sails, and the mast as it lay along,</p>
			<p class="i0">Row upon row were the heroes sitting all in a throng;</p>
			<p class="i0">And to these of his heart’s good will the son of Aison spake:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘What things soever it needeth that sea-bound galleys should take,</p>
			<p class="i0">All this ready dight for our going lieth in seemly array.</p>
			<p class="i0">Wherefore for these things’ sake will we make no longer delay</p>
			<p class="i0">From our sailing, so soon as the breezes but blow for the voyage begun.</p>
			<p class="i0">But, friends⁠—since in hope for the home-return to our land we be one,</p>
			<p class="i0">And one in the way we must take to Aiêtes, the path of the Quest,</p>
			<p class="i0">Therefore do ye now choose with hearts ungrudging our best</p>
			<p class="i0">To be chief and captain, to order all our goings aright,</p>
			<p class="i0">To take on him our quarrels with aliens, and pledge our covenant-plight.’</p>
			<p class="i1">He spake, and the youths upon valiant Herakles turned their eyes,</p>
			<p class="i0">As he sat in their midst, and from all the heroes did one shout rise,</p>
			<p class="i0">Crying ‘Our captain be thou!’⁠—but not from his place he stirred;</p>
			<p class="i0">But he stretched his right hand forth, and he answered and spake the word:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Let no man offer this honour to me: I will nowise consent;</p>
			<p class="i0">And if any man else would arise, I will also withstand his intent.</p>
			<p class="i0">The selfsame man who assembled our band, let him too lead.’</p>
			<p class="i1">He spake in his greatness of soul, and they shouted, praising the rede</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Herakles: then did Jason the warrior wight rejoice;</p>
			<p class="i0">And he sprang to his feet, and he spake in their midst with eager voice:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘If indeed ye be minded on me this glorious charge to cast,</p>
			<p class="i0">Let our voyaging tarry no more; suffice the delays overpast.</p>
			<p class="i0">But now, even now, let us offer to Phœbus the sacrifice meet,</p>
			<p class="i0">And prepare us a feast even here; and, while yet tarry the feet</p>
			<p class="i0">Of my thralls, overseers of my steading, which bear in charge my command</p>
			<p class="i0">Fitly to choose for us beasts from the herd, and to drive to the strand,</p>
			<p class="i0">We will launch on the sea our ship, we will set up her tackling therein,</p>
			<p class="i0">And thwart by thwart cast lots for the place each oarsman shall win.</p>
			<p class="i0">To Apollo, the Seafarers’ Saviour, uppile we then on the beach</p>
			<p class="i0">An altar; for whatso I needs must do hath he promised to teach,</p>
			<p class="i0">And to show us the paths of the sea, if first with sacrifice</p>
			<p class="i0">I seek unto him, or ever I strive with the king for the prize.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake he, and turned him first to the work; and, his call to obey,</p>
			<p class="i0">The heroes arose, and their garments row upon row heaped they</p>
			<p class="i0">On a smooth rock-shelf: the waves of the sea beat not thereon;</p>
			<p class="i0">But the dash of the stormy brine had cleansed it long agone.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then, giving heed to the counsels of Argus, stoutly they braced</p>
			<p class="i0">The ship with a hawser deftly twisted that girded her waist;</p>
			<p class="i0">For they strained it from side to side, that the beams to the bolts might hold</p>
			<p class="i0">Fast, and withstand the might of the meeting surge on-rolled.</p>
			<p class="i0">And a trench, in compass as great as the width of the galley, they delved;</p>
			<p class="i0">And overagainst her prow to the sea so far it shelved</p>
			<p class="i0">As the space that the hull should run, by the might of their hands on-sped:</p>
			<p class="i0">And deepening ever afront of her stern they scooped that bed.</p>
			<p class="i0">And smoothly-shaven rollers they laid in the furrow arow.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then down on the foremost rollers slowly they tilted her prow,</p>
			<p class="i0">That adown them one after other with one smooth rush she might slide.</p>
			<p class="i0">Thereafter above did they pass the oars from side to side;</p>
			<p class="i0">To the tholes did they lash them, outstanding a cubit on either hand;</p>
			<p class="i0">And to right of the ship and to left at these did they take their stand;</p>
			<p class="i0">And with chest and with hands against them they bare, and to and fro</p>
			<p class="i0">Went Tiphys the while, to shout in the season the yo-heave-ho.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then gave he the word with a mighty shout, and the youths forthright</p>
			<p class="i0">Drave her with one rush down, as they thrust with their uttermost might,</p>
			<p class="i0">From her berth in the sand, as with feet hard-straining strongly they stept</p>
			<p class="i0">Forcing her forward, and Pelian Argo seaward swept</p>
			<p class="i0">Full swiftly, and shouted they all, as to right and to left they leapt.</p>
			<p class="i0">And under the massy keel’s heavy grinding groaned aloud</p>
			<p class="i0">The rollers, and spirted about them the smoke in a dusky cloud</p>
			<p class="i0">’Neath the crushing weight: and into the sea she slid, and her crew</p>
			<p class="i0">Back with the hawsers warped her, and stayed her as onward she flew.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then the oars to the tholes they fitted on either side, and the mast</p>
			<p class="i0">And the well-fashioned sails, and the tackling withal, therein they cast.</p>
			<p class="i1">But soon as with diligent heed they had ordered all things so,</p>
			<p class="i0">First cast they the lots for the thwarts whereat each man should row,</p>
			<p class="i0">Allotting one unto two men still; but the midmost thwart</p>
			<p class="i0">For Herakles chose they first, from the rest of the heroes apart;</p>
			<p class="i0">And Ankaius the dweller in Tegea-town for his fellow they chose.</p>
			<p class="i0">So the midmost place of the benches they left unchallenged to those,</p>
			<p class="i0">Neither cast for them lots; and with one consent of the voices of them</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto Tiphys was given the helm of the galley of goodly stem.</p>
			<p class="i1">Then did they heap of the stones of the shingle, and, nigh at hand</p>
			<p class="i0">To the sea, an altar they reared to Apollo the Lord of the Strand,</p>
			<p class="i0">Who is called the Lord of the farers a-shipboard withal, and in haste</p>
			<p class="i0">Billets of olive-wood sapless and dry thereon they placed.</p>
			<p class="i0">And by this were the herdmen of Aison’s son drawn nigh thereto</p>
			<p class="i0">Bringing oxen twain from the herd; and these the young men drew</p>
			<p class="i0">And set them beside the altar; and others stood thereby</p>
			<p class="i0">With the water of sacrifice and the meal. And now drew nigh</p>
			<p class="i0">Jason, and unto Apollo his fathers’ god did he cry:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Hearken, O King, who in Pagasae dwellest, whose fair halls be</p>
			<p class="i0">In the city Aisonian, named of my sire, who didst promise to me,</p>
			<p class="i0">When I sought unto thee at Pytho, to point me my journey’s goal</p>
			<p class="i0">And fulfilment; for thou, even thou, to the emprise didst kindle my soul.</p>
			<p class="i0">Now therefore my ship with my comrades safe and sound bring thou</p>
			<p class="i0">Thither, and back unto Hellas again: and to thee do we vow,</p>
			<p class="i0">For as many of us as shall win safe home, on thine altar to lay</p>
			<p class="i0">Burnt offerings so many of goodly bulls: therewithal will I pay</p>
			<p class="i0">At Pytho thy shrine, and Ortygia, other gifts beyond price.</p>
			<p class="i0">Come then, Far-smiter, accept at our hands this sacrifice,</p>
			<p class="i0">Which now, at our going abroad, for the sake of this our ship</p>
			<p class="i0">We offer, our first of all: and with prosperous weird may I slip</p>
			<p class="i0">The hawsers, by thy devising: and soft bid blow the breeze</p>
			<p class="i0">Whereby we may fare on ever through calm of summer seas.’</p>
			<p class="i1">With the prayer then cast he the meal: and now for the slaughtering these</p>
			<p class="i0">Girded themselves, Ankaius the mighty, and Herakles.</p>
			<p class="i0">And this with his club on the forehead smote the steer mid-head;</p>
			<p class="i0">And heavily all in a heap to the earth it dropped down dead.</p>
			<p class="i0">And Ankaius hewed with his brazen axe at the second steer</p>
			<p class="i0">On the broad neck: clean through the sinews strong thereof did it shear;</p>
			<p class="i0">And there on the earth, with horns doubled under its chest, it lay.</p>
			<p class="i0">And swiftly their comrades severed the throats, and the skins did they flay,</p>
			<p class="i0">And they sundered the joints, and they carved, and the sacred thighs they cut out,</p>
			<p class="i0">And they laid them together, and closely with fat they wrapped them about,</p>
			<p class="i0">And burnt on the cloven wood: drink-offerings unmingled of wine</p>
			<p class="i0">Poured Aison’s son; and Idmon rejoiced, beholding shine</p>
			<p class="i0">The splendour that gleamed all round from the sacrifice and the smoke,</p>
			<p class="i0">As forth for an omen of good in wavering wreaths it broke.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the purpose of Leto’s son, nothing doubting, straightway he spoke:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘For you ’tis ordained of the doom of the Gods and of each man’s fate</p>
			<p class="i0">Hither to win with the Fleece; but meanwhile lie in wait</p>
			<p class="i0">Toils without number, as thither ye fare, and as backward ye hie.</p>
			<p class="i0">But for me by the hateful doom of a God is it fated to die</p>
			<p class="i0">Far hence, I know not where, on the Asian mainland shore.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, this is my doom: by birds evil-boding I knew it before;</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet from my fatherland went I: to sail in your galley I came,</p>
			<p class="i0">That so to mine house might be left the renown of a hero’s name.’</p>
			<p class="i1">He spake, and the young men, hearing the words of the prophet, were glad</p>
			<p class="i0">For their home-return, but for Idmon’s doom were their hearts made sad.</p>
			<p class="i0">And so, at the hour when the sun from his noon-halt sinketh adown,</p>
			<p class="i0">And over the harvest-lands the long rock-shadows are thrown,</p>
			<p class="i0">As the sun to the eventide dusk slow-slideth aslant from the sky,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even then did the heroes all on the sands of the beach pile high</p>
			<p class="i0">A couch of the wildwood leaves, and in front of the surf-line hoar</p>
			<p class="i0">Row upon row lay down, and beside them was measureless store</p>
			<p class="i0">Of meats, and of sweet strong wine which the cupbearers poured for them out</p>
			<p class="i0">From the pitchers: thereafter they told, as each man’s turn came about,</p>
			<p class="i0">Story and legend, as young men oft at the feast and the bowl</p>
			<p class="i0">Will take their delight, when insatiate violence is far from their soul.</p>
			<p class="i0">But there was Aison’s son, as a man in a nightmare dream,</p>
			<p class="i0">Struggling with deep dark thoughts, and as one distraught did he seem;</p>
			<p class="i0">And Idas marked him askance, and he shouted in scoffing tone:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘What thoughts to and fro in thine heart art thou turning, thou Aison’s son?</p>
			<p class="i0">Speak out in our midst thy mind! Hath fear in thy spirit awoke</p>
			<p class="i0">Overmastering thee⁠—that thing which dazeth dastard folk?</p>
			<p class="i0">Be witness my furious spear, wherewithal beyond others I win</p>
			<p class="i0">Renown in the wars⁠—nor is Zeus so present a helper therein,</p>
			<p class="i0">Nor so mighty to save as my spear⁠—that on thee no deadly bane</p>
			<p class="i0">Shall light, nor shall any strife of thine hands be striven in vain,</p>
			<p class="i0">While Idas attendeth thee, not though against thee a God should arise.</p>
			<p class="i0">Such a helper is this thou hast won from Arênê for thine emprise.’</p>
			<p class="i1">He spake, and the brimming beaker with both hands lifted he up,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the strong wine drank unmingled, and dashed with the dew of the cup</p>
			<p class="i0">Were his lips and his swarthy cheeks: but a startled clamour broke</p>
			<p class="i0">From all together; and openly Idmon rebuked him, and spoke:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Beshrew thee!⁠—thy thoughts thus soon to thyself are deadly and fell!</p>
			<p class="i0">Hath the strong wine caused thy reckless heart for thy ruin to swell</p>
			<p class="i0">In thy breast, and eggeth thee on to set the Gods at nought?</p>
			<p class="i0">Other words of comfort there be wherewithal a man might have sought</p>
			<p class="i0">To hearten his friend; but thy words were wholly presumptuous-bold!</p>
			<p class="i0">So blustered, as telleth the tale, against the Blessèd of old</p>
			<p class="i0">The sons of Alôeus: and thou⁠—thou art nothing so mighty as they</p>
			<p class="i0">In manhood: yet both did the swift shafts overmaster and slay</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the Son of Latona, though giants they were and passing strong.’</p>
			<p class="i1">Then Aphareus’ son brake forth into laughter loud and long,</p>
			<p class="i0">And blinking upon him in drunken wise flung back the jeer:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Come now, by thy deep divination reveal unto me, thou seer,</p>
			<p class="i0">If the Gods for me also be bringing to pass such doom as that</p>
			<p class="i0">Which was dealt of that father of thine to the sons that Alôeus begat.</p>
			<p class="i0">And bethink thee how thou shalt escape from mine hands alive, if we find</p>
			<p class="i0">Thee guilty of boding a prophecy vain as the idle wind!’</p>
			<p class="i1">Wrathfuller waxed he in railing: and now had the strife run high,</p>
			<p class="i0">But amidst of their wrangling their comrades with loud indignant cry,</p>
			<p class="i0">With Aison’s son, restrained them:⁠—and lo, with his lyre upheld</p>
			<p class="i0">In his left hand, Orpheus arose, and the fountain of song upwelled.</p>
			<p class="i1">And he sang how in the beginning the earth and the heaven and the sea</p>
			<p class="i0">In the selfsame form were blended together in unity,</p>
			<p class="i0">And how baleful contention each from other asunder tore;</p>
			<p class="i0">And he sang of the goal of the course in the firmament fixed evermore</p>
			<p class="i0">For the stars and the moon, and the printless paths of the journeying sun,</p>
			<p class="i0">And how the mountains arose, how rivers that babbling run,</p>
			<p class="i0">They and their Nymphs, were born, and whatso moveth on Earth;</p>
			<p class="i0">And he sang how Ophion at first, and Eurynomê, Ocean’s birth,</p>
			<p class="i0">In lordship of all things sat on Olympus’ snow-crowned height;</p>
			<p class="i0">And how Ophion must yield unto Kronos’ hands and his might,</p>
			<p class="i0">And she unto Rhea, and into the Ocean’s waves plunged they.</p>
			<p class="i0">O’er the blessed Titan-gods these twain for a space held sway,</p>
			<p class="i0">While Zeus as yet was a child, while yet as a child he thought,</p>
			<p class="i0">And dwelt in the cave Dictaean, while yet the time was not</p>
			<p class="i0">When the Earth-born Cyclops the thunderbolt’s strength to his hands should give,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even thunder and lightning: by these doth Zeus his glory receive.</p>
			<p class="i1">Low murmured the lyre, and slept, and the voice divine was still:</p>
			<p class="i0">But moveless the heads of them all are bending forward, and thrill</p>
			<p class="i0">Their eager-listening ears, through the hush as they strain, in thrall</p>
			<p class="i0">To the spell; such wondrous glamour the song hath cast over all.</p>
			<p class="i0">And a little thereafter they mingled, even as is meet and right,</p>
			<p class="i0">The wine, and poured on the tongues where the altar-fires blazed bright.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then turned they to sleep, and around them were folded the wings of the night.</p>
			<p class="i1">But when radiant Dawn with her flashing eyes on the steeps looked down</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Pelion’s crests, and, washed by the wind, the forelands that frown</p>
			<p class="i0">Over the tossing sea rose sharp and clear to view,</p>
			<p class="i0">Then Tiphys awoke, and he hasted the Argo’s hero-crew</p>
			<p class="i0">To hie them aboard, and to range the oars in order due.</p>
			<p class="i0">And a weird dread cry from the haven of Pagasae rang to them; yea,</p>
			<p class="i0">From Pelian Argo herself came a voice, bidding hasten away:</p>
			<p class="i0">For within her a beam divine had been laid, which Athênê brought</p>
			<p class="i0">From the oak Dodonaean, and into the midst of her stem was it wrought.</p>
			<p class="i0">So the heroes went up to the thwarts, and twain after twain arow,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even as fell the places by lot but a little ago,</p>
			<p class="i0">Orderly ranged sat down, and by each was his harness of fight.</p>
			<p class="i0">On the midmost Ankaius, and next him Herakles’ giant might</p>
			<p class="i0">Sat, and beside him he laid his club; and the keel of the ship</p>
			<p class="i0">Under his massy tread plunged deep. And now did they slip</p>
			<p class="i0">The hawsers, and poured on the sea the wine. Tear-dimmed that day</p>
			<p class="i0">Were Jason’s eyes, from the fatherland-home as he turned them away.</p>
			<p class="i0">And these⁠—as the youths that in Pytho begin unto Phœbus the dance,</p>
			<p class="i0">In Ortygia, or there where Ismenus’ ripples in sunlight glance,</p>
			<p class="i0">Hand in hand to the notes of the lyre his altar around</p>
			<p class="i0">With rhythmical fall of the feet swift-circling beat the ground⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">So smote with the oars, by the lyre of Orpheus timing the stroke,</p>
			<p class="i0">The sea’s wild water, and over the blades the surges broke.</p>
			<p class="i0">And on this side and that with the foam the dark brine seething flashed;</p>
			<p class="i0">Like muttered thunder it sounded by strokes of the mighty updashed.</p>
			<p class="i0">And glanced in the sun like flame, as the ship winged onward her flight,</p>
			<p class="i0">Their armour: the wake far-weltering ever behind gleamed white,</p>
			<p class="i0">As an oft-trodden path through a grassy plain lieth clear in sight.</p>
			<p class="i0">And all the Gods that day from the height of the heaven looked down</p>
			<p class="i0">On the ship, and the might of the demigod heroes, the men of renown,</p>
			<p class="i0">Sailing the sea; and afar on the crests of the hill-tops lone</p>
			<p class="i0">The Maids of the Mountain, the Pelian Nymphs, in amaze looked on</p>
			<p class="i0">At the work of Athênê Itônis, the heroes’ goodly array,</p>
			<p class="i0">As the ashen blades in their hands kept time with measured sway.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, and there came one down from the mountain’s height to the shore,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even Cheiron, Philyra’s son, and plashed the surf-wash hoar</p>
			<p class="i0">On his feet, as his broad hand waving many a farewell sent,</p>
			<p class="i0">And he shouted, ‘Good speed, and a sorrowless home-return!’ as they went.</p>
			<p class="i0">And there was his wife, with Peleus’ babe in her arms held high,</p>
			<p class="i0">Achilles, waving a greeting as sped his sire thereby.</p>
			<p class="i1">So when they had rounded the headland, and left the haven behind</p>
			<p class="i0">By the cunning and wisdom of Hagnias’ son the prudent of mind⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Even of Tiphys, who swayed in the master-craftsman’s grip</p>
			<p class="i0">The helm smooth-shaven, to guide unswerving the course of the ship⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Then set they up in the centre-block the towering mast,</p>
			<p class="i0">And on either hand strained taut the stays, and they lashed them fast;</p>
			<p class="i0">And the sail they unfurled therefrom, from the yard-arm spreading it wide.</p>
			<p class="i0">And a breeze shrill-piping upsprang, and the sheets upon either side</p>
			<p class="i0">O’er the polished pins on the deck then cast they in order meet;</p>
			<p class="i0">And past the long Tisaian ness did they restfully fleet.</p>
			<p class="i0">And Orpheus, in song whose rhythmical cadence kept time to the lyre,</p>
			<p class="i0">Sang of the Saviour of Ships, the Child of the Glorious Sire,</p>
			<p class="i0">Artemis, she that hath those crags of the sea in her keeping,</p>
			<p class="i0">The Lady that wardeth Iolkos-land. And the fishes leaping</p>
			<p class="i0">Up from the deep sea came, and, drawn by the spell of the lay,</p>
			<p class="i0">Both small and great followed gambolling over the watery way.</p>
			<p class="i0">And as when in the track of a shepherd, the warder of flocks on the wold,</p>
			<p class="i0">Follow sheep that have fed to the full of the grass, a throng untold,</p>
			<p class="i0">And he goeth before with his shrill reed piping them home to the fold,</p>
			<p class="i0">As sweetly he fluteth a shepherd’s strain⁠—so over the seas</p>
			<p class="i0">Followed the fishes: on wafted her ever the chasing breeze.</p>
			<p class="i1">And ere long melting in haze the Pelasgians’ land of corn</p>
			<p class="i0">Sank out of sight; and past Mount Pelion’s cliffs were they borne</p>
			<p class="i0">Aye running onward; and sank in the offing the Sepian strand,</p>
			<p class="i0">And sea-girt Skiathos rose, and a far-away gleam of sand,</p>
			<p class="i0">The Peiresian beach and Magnesian, clear in the summer air</p>
			<p class="i0">On the mainland; and lo, the barrow of Dolops: at eventide there</p>
			<p class="i0">Beached they the ship, for against them the veering breeze had turned.</p>
			<p class="i0">And they honoured the dead, and victims of sheep in the gloaming they burned,</p>
			<p class="i0">While the sea-surge stormily tossed. Two days to and fro on the shore</p>
			<p class="i0">They loitered, but ran on the third their galley asea once more;</p>
			<p class="i0">And the broad sail spread they on high, and the keel from the strand shot away:</p>
			<p class="i0">Men call it ‘The Launching of Argo’⁠—Aphetai⁠—unto this day.</p>
			<p class="i1">Onward they ran, ever onward: they left Meliboia behind;</p>
			<p class="i0">They caught but a glimpse of the foam-flecked beach of the stormy wind:</p>
			<p class="i0">And with dawning on Homolê looked they, and lo, it was looming anigh;</p>
			<p class="i0">Broad-couched on the breast of the waters it lay as they passed it by.</p>
			<p class="i0">Thereafter full soon by the outfall of Amyrus’ flood must they fly.</p>
			<p class="i0">Eurymenê then, and the surf-tormented gorges they spied</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Olympus’ and Ossa’s seaward face: wind-wafted they ride</p>
			<p class="i0">By the slopes of Pallênê; beyond Kanastra’s foreland-height</p>
			<p class="i0">They passed, running lightly before the breath of the breeze in the night.</p>
			<p class="i0">And before them at dawn on-speeding the pillar of Athos rose,</p>
			<p class="i0">The Thracian mountain: its topmost peak’s dark shadow it throws</p>
			<p class="i0">Far as a merchantman goodly-rigged in a day might win,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even to Lemnos’ isle, and the city Myrinê therein.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the wind blew all that day till the folds of the darkness fell,</p>
			<p class="i0">Blew ever fresh, and the sail strained over the broad sea-swell.</p>
			<p class="i0">Howbeit the wind’s breath failed them at going down of the sun:</p>
			<p class="i0">So to Lemnos the craggy, the Sintian isle, by rowing they won.</p>
			<p class="i1">There all the men of the nation together pitilessly</p>
			<p class="i0">By the violent hands of the women were slain in the year gone by;</p>
			<p class="i0">Forasmuch as the hearts of the men from their lawful wives had turned,</p>
			<p class="i0">And in love for their captive handmaids with baleful passion they burned,</p>
			<p class="i0">Maids that themselves from the Thracian land in foray had brought</p>
			<p class="i0">Oversea:⁠—’twas the wrath of the Cyprian Queen that curse had wrought,</p>
			<p class="i0">Because that for long they had left her unhonoured by sacrifice:⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Ah hapless, whose hungering jealousy craved that woeful price!</p>
			<p class="i0">For not with the captives their husbands alone for the sin did they slay,</p>
			<p class="i0">But every male therewithal, lest perchance in the coming day</p>
			<p class="i0">Out of these might arise an avenger for that grim murder’s sake.</p>
			<p class="i0">In one alone for an aged sire did compassion awake,</p>
			<p class="i0">Hypsipylê, daughter of Thoas, the king of the folk of the land.</p>
			<p class="i0">In an ark did she send him to drift o’er the sea from the murder-strand,</p>
			<p class="i0">If he haply might ’scape. And fisher-folk saved him and brought to the isle</p>
			<p class="i0">Which men call Sikinus now, but Oinoë named it erewhile;</p>
			<p class="i0">For from Sikinus folk renamed it, the child whom the Maid of the Spring,</p>
			<p class="i0">Oinoë, bare, when she couched in love with Thoas the king.</p>
			<p class="i1">So it came to pass that for these to tend the kine, and to wear</p>
			<p class="i0">War-harness of brass, and to furrow the wheat-bearing land with the share,</p>
			<p class="i0">In the eyes of them all seemed task more light than Athênê’s toil</p>
			<p class="i0">Wherewithal were their hands aforetime busy: yet all the while</p>
			<p class="i0">Across the broad sea ever they cast and anon their eyes</p>
			<p class="i0">With a haunting fear lest the Thracian sails in the offing should rise.</p>
			<p class="i1">So when they beheld the Argo’s oars flashing down to their coast,</p>
			<p class="i0">Forth from the gates of Myrinê straightway in one great host</p>
			<p class="i0">Clad in their harness of battle down to the beach they poured</p>
			<p class="i0">Like unto ravening Thyiads: they weened that the Thracian horde</p>
			<p class="i0">Were come: and there was Hypsipylê clad in the war-array</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Thoas her father: and all these speechless with wildered dismay</p>
			<p class="i0">Streamed down⁠—such panic was wafted about them all that day.</p>
			<p class="i1">But forth of the galley the while had the chieftains sent to the shore</p>
			<p class="i0">Aithalides, their herald swift, the man who bore</p>
			<p class="i0">Charge of their messages, yea, and the wand they committed to him</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Hermes his sire, who had given him memory never made dim</p>
			<p class="i0">Of all things:⁠—yea, nor forgetfulness swept even now o’er his soul</p>
			<p class="i0">Of long-left Acheron’s flow, where the torrents unspeakable roll.</p>
			<p class="i0">For the doom of his spirit is fixed, to and fro evermore is it swept,</p>
			<p class="i0">Now numbered with ghosts underground, now back to the light hath it leapt,</p>
			<p class="i0">To the beams of the sun among living men:⁠—but why should I tell</p>
			<p class="i0">The story of Aithalides that all men know full well?</p>
			<p class="i0">Of him was Hypsipylê won to receive that sea-borne array</p>
			<p class="i0">As waned the day to the gloaming: yet not with the new-born day</p>
			<p class="i0">Unmoored they the ship for the North-wind’s breathing to waft away.</p>
			<p class="i1">Through the city the daughters of Lemnos into the folkmote pressed,</p>
			<p class="i0">And there sat down, as Hypsipylê’s self sent forth her behest.</p>
			<p class="i0">So when they were gathered in one great throng to the market-stead,</p>
			<p class="i0">For their counselling straightway she rose in the midst of them all, and she said:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Friends, now, an ye will, good store of gifts to the men give we,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even such as is meet that the farers a-shipboard should bear oversea,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even meats and the sweet strong wine, that without our towers so</p>
			<p class="i0">They may bide, nor for need’s sake passing amidst of us to and fro</p>
			<p class="i0">May know of us all too well, and our evil report shall go</p>
			<p class="i0">Afar, for a terrible deed have we wrought, and in no wise, I trow,</p>
			<p class="i0">Good in their sight shall it seem, if they haply shall hear the tale.</p>
			<p class="i0">Lo, this is our counsel, and this, meseemeth, best shall avail.</p>
			<p class="i0">But if any amidst you hath counsel that better shall serve our need</p>
			<p class="i0">Let her rise; for to this have I summoned you, even the giving of rede.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake she, and sat her down on the ancient chair of stone</p>
			<p class="i0">That of old was her sire’s, and Polyxo her nurse uprose thereupon.</p>
			<p class="i0">On her wrinkle-shrivelled feet she halted for very eld</p>
			<p class="i0">Bowed over a staff; but with longing for speech the heart in her swelled.</p>
			<p class="i0">And hard by her side were there sitting ancient maidens four,</p>
			<p class="i0">Virgins, whose heads with the thin white hair were silvered o’er.</p>
			<p class="i0">And amidst of the folkmote stood she, and up from her crook-bowed back</p>
			<p class="i0">Feebly a little she lifted her neck, and in this wise spake:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Gifts, even as unto the lady Hypsipylê seemeth meet,</p>
			<p class="i0">Send we to the strangers, for thus were it better their coming to greet.</p>
			<p class="i0">But you⁠—by what art or device shall ye save your souls alive</p>
			<p class="i0">If a Thracian host burst on you, or cometh in battle to strive</p>
			<p class="i0">Some other foe?⁠—there be many such chances to men that befall,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even as now yon array cometh unforeseen of us all.</p>
			<p class="i0">But if one of the Blessèd should turn this affliction away, there remain</p>
			<p class="i0">Countless afflictions beside, far worse than the battle’s strain.</p>
			<p class="i0">For when through the gates of the grave the older women have passed,</p>
			<p class="i0">And childless the younger have won to a joyless eld at the last,</p>
			<p class="i0">How then will ye live, O hapless?⁠—what, will the beasts freewilled</p>
			<p class="i0">On their own necks cast the yoke, to the end that your lands may be tilled?</p>
			<p class="i0">And the furrow-sundering share will they drag through the heavy loam?</p>
			<p class="i0">And, as rolleth the year round, straight will they bring you the harvest home?</p>
			<p class="i0">Now, albeit from me the Fates still shrink as in loathing and fear,</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet surely on me, when the feet draw nigh of another year,</p>
			<p class="i0">The earth shall lie, when the burial rites have been rendered to me,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even as is due, and the evil days I shall not see.</p>
			<p class="i0">But for you which be younger, I counsel you, give good heed unto this,</p>
			<p class="i0">For that now at your feet an open way of deliverance there is,</p>
			<p class="i0">If ye will but commit your dwellings and all your spoil to the guard</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the strangers, yea, and your goodly city for these to ward.’</p>
			<p class="i1">She spake, and with clamour the folkmote was filled, for good in their eyes</p>
			<p class="i0">Was the word, and straightway thereafter again did Hypsipylê rise,</p>
			<p class="i0">And her voice pealed over the multitude, stilling the mingled cries:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘If in sooth in the sight of you all well-pleasing is this same rede,</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto the ship straightway a messenger hence will I speed.’</p>
			<p class="i1">To Iphinoê which waited beside her spake she her hest:</p>
			<p class="i0">‘Up, Iphinoê, and to yonder man bear this my request,</p>
			<p class="i0">That he come to our town, even he who is chief of the strangers’ array,</p>
			<p class="i0">For the word that pleaseth the heart of my people to him would I say.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, and his fellows bid thou to light in friendship down</p>
			<p class="i0">On our shore, if they will, and to enter undismayed our town.’</p>
			<p class="i1">She spake, and dismissed the assembly, and homeward she wended her way;</p>
			<p class="i0">But Iphinoê to the Minyans went; and they bade her say</p>
			<p class="i0">What was the mind wherewithal she was come, and what her need.</p>
			<p class="i0">And straightway she told them the words of her message with eager speed:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘The daughter of Thoas, Hypsipylê, sent me hither away</p>
			<p class="i0">To summon the lord of your ship, and the captain of your array,</p>
			<p class="i0">That the will of her folk she may tell him, their heart’s desire this day.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, and his fellows she biddeth to light in friendship down</p>
			<p class="i0">On our shore, if they will, and to enter undismayed our town.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake she, and fair in the sight of them all was the word that she said;</p>
			<p class="i0">For they deemed that Hypsipylê reigned in the room of Thoas dead,</p>
			<p class="i0">His daughter, his well-beloved; and they hasted Jason to meet</p>
			<p class="i0">The island-queen, and they dight them to follow their captain’s feet.</p>
			<p class="i1">Then he flung o’er his shoulders the web by the Goddess Itonian wrought;</p>
			<p class="i0">In the clasp of a brooch were the folds of the purple of Pallas caught,</p>
			<p class="i0">Which she gave, when for Argo’s building the keel-props first she dight,</p>
			<p class="i0">And taught him with rule of the shipwright to measure her timbers aright.</p>
			<p class="i0">More easy it were in sooth on the sun at his rising to gaze</p>
			<p class="i0">Than to fasten thine eyes on the flush of its glory, its splendour-blaze.</p>
			<p class="i0">For the fashion thereof in the midst was fiery crimson glow,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the top was of purple throughout; and above on the marge and below</p>
			<p class="i0">Picture by picture did many a broidered marvel show.</p>
			<p class="i1">For therein were the Cyclopes bowed o’er their work that perisheth not,</p>
			<p class="i0">Forging the levin of Zeus the King, and so far was it wrought</p>
			<p class="i0">In its fiery splendour, that yet of its flashes there lacked but one:</p>
			<p class="i0">And the giant smiths with their sledges of iron were smiting thereon;</p>
			<p class="i0">While forth of it spurts as of flaming breath ever leapt and anon.</p>
			<p class="i1">And there were the sons of Asôpus’ daughter Antiopê set,</p>
			<p class="i0">Amphion and Zethus: and Thêbê, with towers ungirded as yet,</p>
			<p class="i0">Stood nigh them; and lo, the foundations thereof were they laying but now</p>
			<p class="i0">In fierce haste. Zethus had heaved a craggy mountain’s brow</p>
			<p class="i0">On his shoulders: as one hard straining in toil did the image appear.</p>
			<p class="i0">And Amphion the while to his golden lyre sang loud and clear,</p>
			<p class="i0">On-pacing; and twice so great was the rock that followed anear.</p>
			<p class="i1">And next Kythereia with tresses heavily drooping was shown;</p>
			<p class="i0">And the buckler of onset of Arês she bare: from her shoulder the zone</p>
			<p class="i0">Of her tunic over her left arm fell with a careless grace</p>
			<p class="i0">Low over her breast; and ever she seemed on the shield to gaze,</p>
			<p class="i0">On the face that out of its brazen mirror smiled to her face.</p>
			<p class="i1">And therein was a herd of shaggy kine; for the winning thereof</p>
			<p class="i0">Elektryon’s sons and Teleboan raiders in battle strove:</p>
			<p class="i0">For these were defending their own; but the Taphian rovers were fain</p>
			<p class="i0">To rob them; and drenched was the dewy meadow with that red rain.</p>
			<p class="i0">But with that overmastering host were the herdmen striving in vain.</p>
			<p class="i1">And therein had been fashioned chariots twain in the race that sped.</p>
			<p class="i0">And Pelops was guiding the car that afront in the contest fled;</p>
			<p class="i0">And Hippodameia beside him rode that fateful race.</p>
			<p class="i0">And rushing behind him Myrtilus scourging his steeds gave chase;</p>
			<p class="i0">And Oinomaus with him had couched his lance with a murderous face.</p>
			<p class="i0">But, as snapt at the nave the axle, aslant was he falling in dust,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even as at Pelops’ back he was aiming the treacherous thrust.</p>
			<p class="i1">And therein was Phœbus Apollo, a slender stripling yet,</p>
			<p class="i0">Shooting at him who the ravisher’s hand to the veil had set</p>
			<p class="i0">Of his mother, at Tityos the giant, whom Elarê bare; but the Earth</p>
			<p class="i0">Nursed him, and hid in her womb, and gave to him second birth.</p>
			<p class="i1">And Phrixus the Minyan was there; and it seemed that unto the ram</p>
			<p class="i0">He verily hearkened; it seemed that a voice from the gold-fleeced came.</p>
			<p class="i0">Thou wert hushed to behold them⁠—wouldst cheat thy soul with the hope that perchance</p>
			<p class="i0">Forth of the lifeless lips would break the utterance</p>
			<p class="i0">Of speech⁠—ay, long wouldst thou gaze in expectation’s trance.</p>
			<p class="i1">Such was the gift of Athênê, the Goddess Itonian’s toil.</p>
			<p class="i0">And a lance far-leaping he grasped in his right hand, given erewhile</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the maid Atalanta on Mainalus’ height for the pledge of a friend.</p>
			<p class="i0">Gladly she met him, for sorely her soul desired to wend</p>
			<p class="i0">On the Quest: howbeit the hero himself withheld the maid,</p>
			<p class="i0">For the peril of bitter strife for her love’s sake made him afraid.</p>
			<p class="i1">So he hied him to go to the town, as the radiant star to behold</p>
			<p class="i0">Which a maid, as she draweth her newly-woven curtain’s fold,</p>
			<p class="i0">Beholdeth, as over her dwelling upward it floateth fair;</p>
			<p class="i0">And it charmeth her eyes, flashing out of the depths of the darkling air</p>
			<p class="i0">Flushed with a crimson glory: the maid’s heart leapeth then</p>
			<p class="i0">Lovesick for the youth who is far away amid alien men,</p>
			<p class="i0">Her betrothed, unto whom her parents shall wed her on some glad day:</p>
			<p class="i0">So as a star was the hero treading the cityward way.</p>
			<p class="i1">So when he had passed through the gates, and within the city he came,</p>
			<p class="i0">The women thereof thronged after, and wafted him blithe acclaim,</p>
			<p class="i0">Having joy of the stranger: but earthward ever his eyes he cast,</p>
			<p class="i0">Pacing unfaltering on till he came to the palace at last</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Hypsipylê: then at the hero’s appearing the maids flung wide</p>
			<p class="i0">The gates and the fair-fashioned boards of the leaves on either side.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then through the beautiful hall did Iphinoê lead on</p>
			<p class="i0">Swiftly, and caused him to sit on a tinsel-glittering throne</p>
			<p class="i0">Facing the Queen; and Hypsipylê turned her eyes away,</p>
			<p class="i0">For the maiden blood flushed hot in her cheek. But her shame that day</p>
			<p class="i0">Tied not her tongue, and with crafty-winsome words did she say:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Stranger, wherefore so long have ye tarried without our towers?</p>
			<p class="i0">Forasmuch as no man dwelleth within this city of ours;</p>
			<p class="i0">But these have betaken them hence to dwell on the Thracian shore,</p>
			<p class="i0">And there are they ploughing the wheat-bearing lands. I will tell thee o’er</p>
			<p class="i0">The evil tale, to the end ye also may understand.</p>
			<p class="i0">In the days when Thoas my father was king o’er the folk of the land,</p>
			<p class="i0">My people in ships from Lemnos over the sea-ridges rode,</p>
			<p class="i0">And harried the homes of the Thracians that overagainst us abode;</p>
			<p class="i0">And with booty untold they returned, and with many a captive maid.</p>
			<p class="i0">But the curse of a baneful Goddess upon them now was laid;</p>
			<p class="i0">For the Cyprian caused on their souls heart-ruining blindness to fall,</p>
			<p class="i0">That they hated their lawful wives, and forth from bower and hall</p>
			<p class="i0">At the beck of their folly they drove the Lemnian matrons away,</p>
			<p class="i0">And beside those spear-won thralls in the bed of love they lay⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Cruel ones! Sooth, long time we endured it, if haply again,</p>
			<p class="i0">Though late, their hearts might be turned; but our wrong and our bitter pain</p>
			<p class="i0">Waxed evermore twofold; and the children of true-born blood</p>
			<p class="i0">In our halls were dishonoured, and grew up amidst us a bastard brood.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, and our maids unwedded, and widowed wives thereto,</p>
			<p class="i0">Uncared for about our city wandered to and fro.</p>
			<p class="i0">No father had heeded, no, never so little, his daughter’s plight,</p>
			<p class="i0">Not though before his eyes he beheld her slain outright</p>
			<p class="i0">By a tyrannous stepdame’s hands: and sons would defend no more</p>
			<p class="i0">A mother from outrage and shame, as they wont in the days of yore.</p>
			<p class="i0">No love for a sister then the heart of the brother bore.</p>
			<p class="i0">But only the handmaid-thralls in the home found grace in their sight,</p>
			<p class="i0">In the dance, in the market-place, and whenso the banquet was dight.</p>
			<p class="i0">Till at last some God in our hearts this desperate courage awoke,</p>
			<p class="i0">No more to receive them, when back they returned from the Thracian folk,</p>
			<p class="i0">Our towers within, that so they might heed the right, or begone</p>
			<p class="i0">Hence to another land, even they and their thralls war-won.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then required they of us their sons, even what manchild soe’er</p>
			<p class="i0">Had been left in the town, and returned unto Thrace; and to this day there</p>
			<p class="i0">The Lemnian men on the snowy Thracian corn-lands dwell.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then tarry ye sojourning here: and if haply it please thee well</p>
			<p class="i0">To abide in the land, and it seem to thee good, of a surety thine</p>
			<p class="i0">Shall be Thoas my father’s honour. I ween this land of mine</p>
			<p class="i0">Thou shalt scorn not, for passing fruitful it is above all the rest</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the myriad isles that lie on the broad Aegean’s breast.</p>
			<p class="i0">But come now, go to thy galley, and tell these words of ours</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto thy comrades, nor longer tarry without our towers.’</p>
			<p class="i1">She ended, with fair words veiling the deed of murder dread</p>
			<p class="i0">Done on the men; and the hero answered the queen, and he said:</p>
			<p class="i0">‘Hypsipylê, passing welcome this thy request shall be</p>
			<p class="i0">Which thou tenderest us, whose desire withal is now unto thee.</p>
			<p class="i0">Back through thy town will I come, when an end I have made to say</p>
			<p class="i0">All this to my fellows in order: howbeit let all the sway</p>
			<p class="i0">And the lordship be thine in the island. I make not in scorn my request,</p>
			<p class="i0">But a sore task thrusteth me onward still, and I may not rest.’</p>
			<p class="i0">He spake, and the queen’s right hand hath he touched, and aback to the strand</p>
			<p class="i0">He hath turned him to go; and around him the maidens on either hand</p>
			<p class="i0">Danced blithely, a throng unnumbered, till forth of the gates he had strode.</p>
			<p class="i0">Thereafter the women loaded them wains smooth-running, and rode</p>
			<p class="i0">Down to the beach, and gifts of greeting they bare good store,</p>
			<p class="i0">When now to his fellows the hero had told the message o’er,</p>
			<p class="i0">Which Hypsipylê spake unto him when she sent and bade him come.</p>
			<p class="i0">And with little ado the maidens drew the heroes home</p>
			<p class="i0">To their halls; for sweet desire did the Lady of Cyprus awake,</p>
			<p class="i0">For a grace to Hephaistus the Lord of Craft, that Lemnos might take</p>
			<p class="i0">New life, and unruined be peopled of men once more for his sake.</p>
			<p class="i0">Now into Hypsipylê’s royal palace Aison’s son</p>
			<p class="i0">Hath passed, and the rest, as it happed unto each man, so are they gone,</p>
			<p class="i0">Save Herakles only; for still with the ship would the hero abide,</p>
			<p class="i0">For he willed it so, and a few his chosen comrades beside.</p>
			<p class="i0">And straightway rejoiced the city with dance and with festival,</p>
			<p class="i0">And was filled with sacrifice-steam to the Deathless: but most of all</p>
			<p class="i0">Honoured they Hêrê’s glorious son, and atonement’s price</p>
			<p class="i0">To the Cyprian Queen they paid with song and with sacrifice.</p>
			<p class="i0">And ever from day unto day did the heroes their sailing forbear,</p>
			<p class="i0">Loth to depart; and long had they tarried loitering there,</p>
			<p class="i0">But Herakles gathered his comrades, and drew from the women apart,</p>
			<p class="i0">And with words of upbraiding he spake, and rebuked them indignant of heart:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘What, sirs, is it blood of kindred spilt that maketh us roam</p>
			<p class="i0">From our land?⁠—or came ye, because that ye found no brides at home,</p>
			<p class="i0">Hitherward, scorning the maidens of Greece? Doth it please you to toil</p>
			<p class="i0">Here dwelling, and driving the plough through the soft smooth Lemnian soil?</p>
			<p class="i0">Good sooth, but little renown shall we win of our tarrying</p>
			<p class="i0">Here long time with the stranger women! No God will bring</p>
			<p class="i0">That Fleece unto us, nor wrest from its warder, for our request!</p>
			<p class="i0">Forth let us go each man to his place⁠—<i>him</i> leave ye to rest</p>
			<p class="i0">All day on Hypsipylê’s couch, till he people from shore to shore</p>
			<p class="i0">Lemnos with menfolk: great his renown shall be therefor!’</p>
			<p class="i1">So did he chide with the band; was none dared meet his eye,</p>
			<p class="i0">Neither look in his face, nor was any man found that essayed reply.</p>
			<p class="i0">But straight from his presence, to make their departing ready, they went</p>
			<p class="i0">In haste; and the women came running, so soon as they knew their intent.</p>
			<p class="i0">And as when round beautiful lilies the wild bees hum at their toil,</p>
			<p class="i0">From their hive in the rock forth pouring; the dew-sprent meadow the while</p>
			<p class="i0">Around them rejoiceth, and hovering, stooping, now and again</p>
			<p class="i0">They sip of the sweet flower-fountains⁠—in such wise round the men</p>
			<p class="i0">Forth streamed the women with yearning faces, making their moan;</p>
			<p class="i0">And with hands caressing and soft sad words did they greet each one,</p>
			<p class="i0">Beseeching the Blessed to grant them a home-coming void of bane.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, so doth Hypsipylê pray, as her clinging fingers strain</p>
			<p class="i0">The hand of Jason, and stream her tears with the parting-pain:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Go thou, and thee may the Gods with thy comrades scathless bring</p>
			<p class="i0">Back to the home-land, bearing the Fleece of Gold to the king,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even as thou wilt, and thine heart desireth: and this mine isle,</p>
			<p class="i0">And my father’s sceptre withal, shall wait for thee the while,</p>
			<p class="i0">If haply, thine home-coming won, thou wouldst choose to come hither again.</p>
			<p class="i0">Thou couldst gather from other cities a host unnumbered of men</p>
			<p class="i0">Lightly⁠—ah, but the longing shall never awaken in thee;</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, and mine own heart bodeth that this shall never be!</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet O remember Hypsipylê whilst thou art far away,</p>
			<p class="i0">And when home thou hast won; and leave me a word that thy love shall obey</p>
			<p class="i0">With joy, if the Gods shall vouchsafe me to bear a son to my lord.’</p>
			<p class="i1">Lovingly looked on her Aison’s son, and he spake the word:</p>
			<p class="i0">‘Hypsipylê, so may the Gods bring all these blessings to be!</p>
			<p class="i0">Howbeit a better wish than this frame thou for me;</p>
			<p class="i0">Forasmuch as by Pelias’ grace it sufficeth me still to live</p>
			<p class="i0">In the home-land⁠—only the Gods from my toils deliverance give!</p>
			<p class="i0">But and if to return to the land of Hellas be not my doom,</p>
			<p class="i0">Afar as I sail, and a fair manchild be the fruit of thy womb,</p>
			<p class="i0">To Pelasgian Iolkos send him, when boyhood and manhood be met,</p>
			<p class="i0">To my father and mother, to solace their grief⁠—if living yet</p>
			<p class="i0">Haply he find them⁠—that so, in the stead of the prince their son,</p>
			<p class="i0">They may win in their halls a dear one, to brighten the hearth left lone.’</p>
			<p class="i0">He spake, and was gone; and afront of his fellows he strode to the ship,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the rest of the chiefs followed on, and the oars in their hands did they grip,</p>
			<p class="i0">Row upon row as they sat; and the hawsers did Argus cast</p>
			<p class="i0">Loose from the rock brine-lashed; and mightily then and fast</p>
			<p class="i0">Fell they to smiting with oars long-bladed the seething wave.</p>
			<p class="i0">And at even by Orpheus’ counsel the keel ashore they drave</p>
			<p class="i0">On the isle of Elektra the daughter of Atlas, that there they might learn</p>
			<p class="i0">The mystic rites whose unveiling is not soul-daunting nor stern,</p>
			<p class="i0">And safelier so might voyage over the chill grey sea:⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">No more will I speak of the Hidden Things⁠—but a blessing be</p>
			<p class="i0">Upon that same isle, and the Gods there dwelling, to whom belong</p>
			<p class="i0">Those rites whereof it is not vouchsafed that we tell in song.</p>
			<p class="i1">And from thence o’er the Black Sea’s depths unfathomed they sped with the oar,</p>
			<p class="i0">To leftward keeping the land of Thrace, and to rightward the shore</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Imbros overagainst it; and, even as sank the sun,</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto the long sea-foreland of Chersonese they won.</p>
			<p class="i0">There did the strong swift south-wind blow, and the sail they spread</p>
			<p class="i0">To the breeze, and into the outward-rushing waters they sped</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Athamas’ daughter: and lo, astern with the morning light</p>
			<p class="i0">The outsea lay, and along Rhœteion’s beach in the night</p>
			<p class="i0">They coasted, and still on their right the land Idaean lay.</p>
			<p class="i0">And they left Dardania behind, and Abydos-ward steered they.</p>
			<p class="i0">By Perkotê in that same night, and Abarnis’ stretches of sand</p>
			<p class="i0">Onward they glided, and past Pityeia the hallowed land.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the selfsame night, as with sails and with oars sped Argo on,</p>
			<p class="i0">Through the sea-gorge darkly-swirling of Hellespont they won.</p>
			<p class="i1">Now within the Propontis an island there is, both high and steep;</p>
			<p class="i0">Short space from the corn-blest Phrygian land doth it rise from the deep</p>
			<p class="i0">Seaward-sloped: to the mainland stretched a neck of land</p>
			<p class="i0">Low as the wash of the sea; so the place hath a twofold strand.</p>
			<p class="i0">And beyond the waterfloods of Aisêpus the river they lie.</p>
			<p class="i0">The Hill of the Bears it is called of them that dwell thereby.</p>
			<p class="i0">And cruel oppressors and fierce have there their robber-hold,</p>
			<p class="i0">Earth-born, a marvel great for the dwellers around to behold.</p>
			<p class="i0">Six mighty arms each monster uplifteth against a foe,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even two from his brawny shoulders that spring, and therebelow</p>
			<p class="i0">Four other, that out of his sides exceeding terrible grow.</p>
			<p class="i0">Now Dolian men on the isthmus abode, and about the plain;</p>
			<p class="i0">And amidst them did Kyzikus, hero-son of Aineus, reign,</p>
			<p class="i0">The son whom Ainêtê, the daughter of godlike Eusôrus, bare.</p>
			<p class="i0">But these men the Earth-born giants, how mighty and dreadful soe’er,</p>
			<p class="i0">In no wise harried: their shield and defender Poseidon became,</p>
			<p class="i0">For himself had begotten of old the first of the Dolian name.</p>
			<p class="i0">Thitherward Argo, as chased by the Thracian breezes she fled,</p>
			<p class="i0">Pressed, and the goodly haven received her as onward she sped.</p>
			<p class="i0">And their light-weight anchor-stone did they cast away thereby</p>
			<p class="i0">By Tiphys’ behest, and they left it beside the fountain to lie,</p>
			<p class="i0">By Artakia’s spring; and another they chose, huge, meet for their need.</p>
			<p class="i0">Howbeit their first, by Archer Apollo’s oracle-rede,</p>
			<p class="i0">The Ionian Neleïds laid thereafter, a hallowed stone,</p>
			<p class="i0">In the shrine of Athênê, Jason’s friend, as was meet to be done.</p>
			<p class="i1">And in all lovingkindness the Dolians came, and to meet them pressed</p>
			<p class="i0">Kyzikus’ self, when their lineage he heard, and was ware of the Quest,</p>
			<p class="i0">And knew what heroes were these; and with glad guest-welcome they met,</p>
			<p class="i0">And besought them to speed in their rowing a short space onward yet,</p>
			<p class="i0">And to fasten the hawser within the city’s haven fair.</p>
			<p class="i0">To Apollo the Lord of Landing they builded an altar there:</p>
			<p class="i0">By the strand they upreared it, and there did the smoke of the sacrifice rise;</p>
			<p class="i0">And sweet strong wine did the king’s self give them, their need to suffice,</p>
			<p class="i0">And sheep therewithal: for an oracle rang in his ears⁠—‘In the day</p>
			<p class="i0">When a godlike band of heroes shall come, meet thou their array</p>
			<p class="i0">With welcome of love, and thou shalt not bethink thee at all of the fray.’</p>
			<p class="i0">And, like unto Jason, the soft down bloomed on the young king’s chin;</p>
			<p class="i0">Neither yet was he gladdened with laughter of children his halls within;</p>
			<p class="i0">For the pangs of the travailing hour not yet to his bride had been known,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even to the lady born of Merops, Perkosius’ son,</p>
			<p class="i0">Fair-tressed Kleitê. But now had she passed from her sire’s halls forth</p>
			<p class="i0">On the mainland-shore, when he won her with gifts of priceless worth.</p>
			<p class="i0">But for all this left he his bridal bower and the bed of his bride,</p>
			<p class="i0">And arrayed them a banquet, and cast from his heart all fear aside.</p>
			<p class="i0">And they questioned each other, the king and the heroes. Of them would he learn</p>
			<p class="i0">The end whereunto they voyaged, and Pelias’ bidding stern.</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the dwellers around, and their cities, they asked and were fain to be taught</p>
			<p class="i0">Touching all the gulf of Propontis the wide: but the king knew nought</p>
			<p class="i0">Beyond to tell them, albeit with eager desire they sought.</p>
			<p class="i0">So at dawn did they climb huge Dindymus’ sides, with purpose to gaze</p>
			<p class="i0">With their own eyes over the unknown sea and her trackless ways;⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">But forth of the outer haven first their galley they rowed;⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Still Jason’s Path is it named, that mountain-track they trode.</p>
			<p class="i1">But the earth-born giants the while rushed down from the mountain-side,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the seaward mouth they blocked of the haven of Chytos the wide</p>
			<p class="i0">With crags, like men that lie in wait for a wolf in his lair.</p>
			<p class="i0">Howbeit with them that were younger had Herakles tarried there;</p>
			<p class="i0">And he leapt to his feet, and against them his back-springing bow did he strain.</p>
			<p class="i0">One after other he stretched them on earth; and the giants amain</p>
			<p class="i0">Heaved up huge jagged rocks, and hurled them against their foe.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, for that terrible monster-brood was nurtured, I trow,</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Hêrê, the bride of Zeus, for a trial of Herakles.</p>
			<p class="i0">Therewithal came the rest of their fellows, returning to battle with these</p>
			<p class="i0">Or ever they won the mountain-crest. To the slaughter they fell</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the Earth-born brood, those heroes: with arrows some did they quell,</p>
			<p class="i0">And some on the points of their spears they received, until they had slain</p>
			<p class="i0">All that to grapple of fight had rushed so furious-fain.</p>
			<p class="i0">And even as when the woodmen with axes have smitten, and throw</p>
			<p class="i0">The long beams down on the strand of the sea ranged row upon row⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">For the brine-sodden wood shall grip the strong bolts faster so⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Even so at the entering-in of the foam-fringed haven they lay</p>
			<p class="i0">One after other; some in a huddled heap where the spray</p>
			<p class="i0">Dashed over their heads and their breasts, the while, stretched high on the land,</p>
			<p class="i0">Stiffened their limbs: there were some yet again, whose heads on the sand</p>
			<p class="i0">Rested, the while in the heaving waters swayed their feet;⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">But doomed were they all alike for the birds’ and the fishes’ meat.</p>
			<p class="i1">And the heroes, so soon as the peril afar from their emprise was driven,</p>
			<p class="i0">Cast loose the hawsers of Argo before the breezes of heaven.</p>
			<p class="i0">Forth shot she, and onward they drave, fast cleaving the broad sea-swell.</p>
			<p class="i0">All day under canvas she ran: howbeit, as twilight fell</p>
			<p class="i0">No longer the wind-rush steadily held, but the veering blast</p>
			<p class="i0">Caught them, and swept them aback, till it brought them again at the last</p>
			<p class="i0">To the guest-fain Dolian men. Then stepped they ashore in the gloom</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the night; and unto this day is it called the Rock of Doom</p>
			<p class="i0">Round which the hawsers of Argo in blind haste now did they pass;</p>
			<p class="i0">Neither did any man deem that the selfsame island it was;</p>
			<p class="i0">Nor yet were the Dolians ware that again in the night to their coast</p>
			<p class="i0">The heroes were come, but haply they weened that a Makrian host</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Pelasgian men for war had sailed to their land overseas:</p>
			<p class="i0">Wherefore their armour they donned, and uplifted their hands against these.</p>
			<p class="i0">And with onset of spears and with clashing of shields met they in the strife,</p>
			<p class="i0">Like to the vehement blast of flame which hath leapt into life</p>
			<p class="i0">Mid the copses dry, and the red tongues climb: and the battle-din then</p>
			<p class="i0">Fearful and furious fell in the midst of the Dolian men.</p>
			<p class="i0">Nor may Kyzikus now overleap his weird, and aback from the war</p>
			<p class="i0">Win home to the bower of love and the arms of his bride any more.</p>
			<p class="i0">But, even as he turned on him, full on the king leapt Aison’s son,</p>
			<p class="i0">And stabbed in the midst of his breast, and shattered was all the bone</p>
			<p class="i0">Around the spear, and falling in death-throes down on the sands</p>
			<p class="i0">He filled up the measure of Fate. To escape her resistless hands</p>
			<p class="i0">Is vouchsafed unto none: as a wide snare compassed we are with her bands.</p>
			<p class="i0">Even so, as he weened that the bitterness now of death was past</p>
			<p class="i0">At the hands of the heroes, lo, in her gin were his feet caught fast</p>
			<p class="i0">In the night, as he battled with them, and many a champion withal</p>
			<p class="i0">Was slain with the king; by Herakles’ hands did Telekles fall,</p>
			<p class="i0">And fell Megabrontes; and Sphodris Akastus overthrew;</p>
			<p class="i0">And Zelys, Gephyrus withal, the battle-swift Peleus slew.</p>
			<p class="i0">Telamon’s ashen spear through Basileus’ heart is thrust;</p>
			<p class="i0">Died Promeus by Idas, and Klytius laid Hyakinthus in dust;</p>
			<p class="i0">And the Tyndarids twain slew Phlogius, slew Megalossakes;</p>
			<p class="i0">And valiant Itymoneus fell before Oineus’ son amid these,</p>
			<p class="i0">And Artakes with him, a chieftain of men: and unto this day</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto all these slain do the people the worship of heroes pay.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then wavered the ranks and broke; then fled they in panic affright,</p>
			<p class="i0">As before the swift-winged hawks doth a cloud of doves take flight.</p>
			<p class="i0">Through the gates in a huddled rout they poured, and the town straightway</p>
			<p class="i0">With the war-yell was filled, and backward rolled was the woeful fray.</p>
			<p class="i0">But at dawn were they ware, both these and those, of the cureless ill,</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the ruinous error; and now did bitter anguish fill</p>
			<p class="i0">The Minyan heroes, beholding before them Aineus’ child</p>
			<p class="i0">Stretched in the dust, and Kyzikus lying blood-defiled.</p>
			<p class="i0">For three whole days with rending of hair did they mourn his doom,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even they with the Dolian folk. Thereafter about his tomb</p>
			<p class="i0">Three times in their brazen armour the round of lament did they pace,</p>
			<p class="i0">And buried him: funeral games held they in the selfsame place,</p>
			<p class="i0">As was meet, in the meadow-plain where yet before the eyes</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the folk of the latter day doth the heap of his grave-mound rise.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, neither would Kleitê his wife any more mid the living abide,</p>
			<p class="i0">Forlorn of her lord; but a woefuller evil she added beside</p>
			<p class="i0">To the evil done, when clasping her neck with the noose she died.</p>
			<p class="i0">Ah, but the Wildwood Maids made moan for the beautiful dead;</p>
			<p class="i0">And of all the tears that to earth from their eyes for her sake they shed</p>
			<p class="i0">A fountain the Goddesses made, and the name of it far and wide</p>
			<p class="i0">Hath been heard, even Kleitê, the name of a most unhappy bride.</p>
			<p class="i0">Ah, that was the darkest day that from Zeus did ever befall</p>
			<p class="i0">The daughters and sons of the Dolian race, and in none of them all</p>
			<p class="i0">Was there spirit to taste of food, and their hands for a weary while</p>
			<p class="i0">By reason of grief hung down, and forgat the millstone’s toil:</p>
			<p class="i0">But their lives dragged on, while untouched of the fire was the food that they ate.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, the Ionian folk that in Kyzikus dwell even yet,</p>
			<p class="i0">When they pour drink-offerings year by year, at the city’s mill</p>
			<p class="i0">Grind ever their corn, for the querns in the houses of mourning are still.</p>
			<p class="i1">And the wild winds woke at the sound of their mourning to shriek and to rave</p>
			<p class="i0">Twelve days, twelve nights; and prisoned by wrath of wind and wave</p>
			<p class="i0">Tarried the heroes from sailing, until, on the thirteenth night,</p>
			<p class="i0">When the rest of the wanderers lay for the last time bowed by the might</p>
			<p class="i0">Of slumber on that drear shore, while watch and ward was kept</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Akastus and Mopsus Ampykus’ son over them that slept⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Then over the golden head of Aison’s son did there fly</p>
			<p class="i0">A kingfisher: clear through the hush his happy-boding cry</p>
			<p class="i0">Rang for the lulling of winds; and Mopsus hearkening caught</p>
			<p class="i0">The shore-bird’s note, and he knew it with happy omen fraught.</p>
			<p class="i0">And a God’s hand guided its wing, that it wheeled and shot to the height</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the Argo’s stern, and thereon hath it stayed its arrowy flight.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the seer touched Jason, there on the fleeces soft as he lay</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the sheep, and from slumber he roused him with haste, and thus did he say:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Aison’s son, thou must climb to the temple that standeth there</p>
			<p class="i0">On Dindymus’ rugged height, and make to the Mother thy prayer,</p>
			<p class="i0">The fair-throned Mother of all the Blest: and the stormy blast</p>
			<p class="i0">Shall be stilled. For but now hath a cry by mine ears on the night-wind passed,</p>
			<p class="i0">The weird sea-kingfisher’s cry; and around thy slumbering head</p>
			<p class="i0">Wheeling its flight, it uttered the thing that my lips have said.</p>
			<p class="i0">For swayed by her power be the winds, and the sea, and the earth below,</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea also Olympus crowned with the everlasting snow.</p>
			<p class="i0">And to her, when to heaven from her hills she ascendeth, doth Zeus give place,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even Kronos’ son himself, and all the Deathless Race</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the Blessèd in reverence bow before her awful face.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake he: to hear that word the heart of Jason leapt.</p>
			<p class="i0">Gladsome he sprang from his couch, and his comrades, there as they slept,</p>
			<p class="i0">Did he waken in haste; and he told, as they gathered around him to hear,</p>
			<p class="i0">The prophecy spoken of Mopsus Ampykus’ son, the seer.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then steers from the byre the young men drave, and with speed they pressed</p>
			<p class="i0">Up the steep hill-path with the beasts, till they won to the mountain’s crest.</p>
			<p class="i0">From the Rock of Doom did others the hawsers of Argo slip:</p>
			<p class="i0">To the Thracian haven they rowed, and leapt to the strand; and the ship</p>
			<p class="i0">There guarded they left, for there tarried behind of their fellows a few.</p>
			<p class="i0">And from Dindymus saw they the Makrian cliffs, and full in view</p>
			<p class="i0">The stretch of the Thracian Coast oversea on this side lay,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the Bosporus misty-dim, and the blue hills far away</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Mysia-land, and the river Aisêpus on that side flowed,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the town and the plain Nepeian of Adresteia showed.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then found they the sturdy stock of a vine in the forest that grew,</p>
			<p class="i0">A tree exceeding old: with the axes the same did they hew</p>
			<p class="i0">For the Mountain-goddess’s sacred image: with cunning skill</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the craftsman did Argus carve it; and so on the rugged hill</p>
			<p class="i0">Did they set it up: for the shrine thereof stood tall oaks round,</p>
			<p class="i0">Which of all trees root them the deepest beneath the face of the ground.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then of loose stones built they an altar: with leaves from the oaken spray</p>
			<p class="i0">They wreathed it around, and the sacrifice thereupon did they lay.</p>
			<p class="i0">On the Mother majestic, on Dindymê’s Queen, the while did they call,</p>
			<p class="i0">Who dwelleth in Phrygia: on Tityas they cried, on Kyllênê withal,</p>
			<p class="i0">Who alone be called the Dispensers of Doom⁠—by the judgment-seat</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the Mother Idaean who sit⁠—by all that priesthood of Crete,</p>
			<p class="i0">The Daktylians of Ida, born in the cave Dictaean of yore</p>
			<p class="i0">When the Nymph Anchialê clutched in the throes of travail, and tore</p>
			<p class="i0">With the fingers of either hand the earth by Oaxus’ shore.</p>
			<p class="i0">Knelt Aison’s son to the Goddess, and prayed her with earnest cries</p>
			<p class="i0">To turn the tempest away, on the flame of the sacrifice</p>
			<p class="i0">As he poured the wine. And the youths therewithal at Orpheus’ command</p>
			<p class="i0">Trode round her altar the measure, an armour-sheathèd band,</p>
			<p class="i0">And clashed with their swords on their shields, that the sound that boded them ill</p>
			<p class="i0">Might be lost in the air, the wail for the dead, which the people still</p>
			<p class="i0">In grief for their king sent up; for which cause unto this day</p>
			<p class="i0">With timbrel and drum the Phrygians worship to Rhea pay.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the Goddess of them that sought her was found, and inclined her ear</p>
			<p class="i0">To the sacrifice-prayer: of her grace did tokens of good appear.</p>
			<p class="i0">For the trees shed fruit in abundance down, and around their feet</p>
			<p class="i0">The earth mid her tender grass with flowers unsown was sweet.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the beasts of the wildwood came, forsaking thicket and lair,</p>
			<p class="i0">Fawning with swaying tails: and another marvel there</p>
			<p class="i0">Did the Goddess create, for that Dindymus never theretofore</p>
			<p class="i0">With watersprings flowed; but now did a sudden torrent pour</p>
			<p class="i0">From her thirsty crest, and the Fountain of Jason they name it still,</p>
			<p class="i0">The folk that in after days dwell round that sacred hill.</p>
			<p class="i0">In the Goddess’s honour a feast on the Bears’ Hill then dight they,</p>
			<p class="i0">And Rhea the all-majestic they hymned: but at dawn of the day</p>
			<p class="i0">Stilled were the winds, and with oars from the island sped they away.</p>
			<p class="i1">Then hero was kindled with hero in gallant contention to try</p>
			<p class="i0">Who last should be spent and refrain; for the peace of a windless sky</p>
			<p class="i0">Laid level the swirls of the sea, and lulled to sleep the wave.</p>
			<p class="i0">And putting their trust in the calm, ever onward and onward they drave</p>
			<p class="i0">The ship by their might; and with her, through the brine as she darted and leapt,</p>
			<p class="i0">Not even the storm-footed steeds of Poseidon the pace had kept.</p>
			<p class="i0">Howbeit the surges awoke as from sleep, as the keen blasts blew,</p>
			<p class="i0">Which swooped from the river-gorges as day to the evenfall drew:</p>
			<p class="i0">And the heroes forspent with toiling refrained, save only one</p>
			<p class="i0">Who by might of his hands tugged onward his weary comrades alone;</p>
			<p class="i0">Even Herakles: quivered the strong-knit beams as he strained to the stroke.</p>
			<p class="i0">But when, as they fled by the mainland-shore of the Mysian folk,</p>
			<p class="i0">And Rhyndakus’ outfall they sighted, and, huge against the sky,</p>
			<p class="i0">Aigaion’s cairn, past Phrygia a little, and slipped thereby,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even then, through the furrows of roughened surge as he tugged and tore,</p>
			<p class="i0">Snapped he the ashen blade, and, grasping the half of the oar</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet in his hands, back Herakles fell, and the half swept down</p>
			<p class="i0">The tossing wake of the ship. But he rose, and with angry frown</p>
			<p class="i0">Sat gazing around, for his hands endured not idle to lie.</p>
			<p class="i1">’Twas the hour when the delver or ploughman aback from the field doth hie</p>
			<p class="i0">With joy to his hut, and his soul sore craveth the eventide meat,</p>
			<p class="i0">And bow on the threshold his knees, and totter his weary feet.</p>
			<p class="i0">All dust-besprent he beholdeth his cramped hands worn with toil,</p>
			<p class="i0">With many a curse reviling the taskmaster Belly the while⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Then came they to where in the land Kianian nestle her homes</p>
			<p class="i0">’Neath Arganthônê, where Kios against the sea-tide foams.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then as friends greet friends did the Mysians with kindly welcoming</p>
			<p class="i0">Meet them, the people that dwelt in the land, and gifts did they bring,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even sheep, and wine without stint therewithal gave they for their need.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then sapless logs did some of them gather, and grass from the mead</p>
			<p class="i0">Did some bring in, whereof great store for their couches they mowed,</p>
			<p class="i0">The while in the hands of some the whirling fire-sticks glowed.</p>
			<p class="i0">Some mingled the wine in the mazer, and ready the feast they dight,</p>
			<p class="i0">Doing sacrifice to Apollo as deepened the shades of night.</p>
			<p class="i1">But Zeus’ son spake to his comrades meetly the feast to prepare:</p>
			<p class="i0">But into the forest himself hath hied, to the end that there,</p>
			<p class="i0">Or ever he supped, for the grip of his hands he might fashion an oar.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then found he a pine as he roved, and scant was the burden it bore</p>
			<p class="i0">Of boughs, nor with heavy-clustering leaves was its shade made dim;</p>
			<p class="i0">But like to the shaft it rose of a poplar tall and slim:</p>
			<p class="i0">Even such was the measure thereof to behold in height and in girth.</p>
			<p class="i0">Swiftly his arrow-fraught quiver hath Herakles cast to the earth</p>
			<p class="i0">With the shafts therein: from his shoulders the lion’s hide did he strip.</p>
			<p class="i0">With his brass-heavy club at its roots he smote, till he loosed earth’s grip.</p>
			<p class="i0">Low down did he grasp the stem about with either hand,</p>
			<p class="i0">Putting trust in his might: with shoulder against it thrust did he stand</p>
			<p class="i0">With feet wide set. From the ground, deep-rooted albeit it grew,</p>
			<p class="i0">Hath his grip upheaved it with all the clods that clave thereto.</p>
			<p class="i0">And as when unawares the mast of a ship, in the very hour</p>
			<p class="i0">When Orion’s storm-fraught setting is working in baleful power,</p>
			<p class="i0">Is struck from on high by a tempest’s swiftly-swooping squall,</p>
			<p class="i0">And with snapped stays rent from its box, and the wedges therewithal,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even so he upwrenched that tree; and he gathered up arrows and bow,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the lion’s hide, and his club; and he hasted him backward to go.</p>
			<p class="i1">But Hylas the while with a pitcher of brass from the throng hath hied</p>
			<p class="i0">Seeking a spring’s pure flow; for the feast of the eventide</p>
			<p class="i0">To draw for him water against his return, and withal to prepare</p>
			<p class="i0">With speed all things for the time when again his lord should be there.</p>
			<p class="i0">For in suchlike service did Herakles nurture the lad and train</p>
			<p class="i0">From the day when, a captive child, by the hero’s hand he was ta’en</p>
			<p class="i0">From the home of his father Theodamas, slain in Dryopian land</p>
			<p class="i0">Without ruth, when he dared for his ploughteam’s sake ’gainst the hero to stand.</p>
			<p class="i0">For it fell, as Theodamas clave with the share the fallow field,</p>
			<p class="i0">That mischief befell him; for Herakles came, and he bade him to yield</p>
			<p class="i0">The heifer he ploughed withal unto him in his heart’s despite:</p>
			<p class="i0">For against the Dryopian folk was he seeking occasion of fight,</p>
			<p class="i0">For their bane, forasmuch as reckless of right in the land dwelt they:⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">But the story thereof should lead me far from my song astray.</p>
			<p class="i0">So in haste to the fountain he hied him, and Pegae hight that spring</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the people that dwell in the field thereabout: and the dancing-ring</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the Nymphs, as it chanced, was there; for all these loved full well⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Even all the Nymphs that about that fair hill wont to dwell⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">In hymns through the night-tide ringing to chant unto Artemis still.</p>
			<p class="i0">But they which inherit the mountain-crest, or the rushing rill,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the Forest-haunters, were ranged from the fountain far away.</p>
			<p class="i0">But it fell that the Water-nymph came floating up that day</p>
			<p class="i0">From the depths of the fair-flowing spring:⁠—lo, over her bendeth his face</p>
			<p class="i0">In the rosy flush of its beauty, its manifold winsome grace.</p>
			<p class="i0">For the full moon casting her beams from the height of the firmament</p>
			<p class="i0">Smote him, and faintness of love on her soul the Cyprian sent,</p>
			<p class="i0">And scarce she unravelled her thoughts in sweet confusion blent.</p>
			<p class="i0">But over the fountain’s brim as aforetime aslant hath he bowed,</p>
			<p class="i0">And plunged in the ripple the pitcher: the water gurgled loud</p>
			<p class="i0">As into the echoing brass it poured; and the Fountain-maid</p>
			<p class="i0">Her left arm slid from the depths, and around his neck was it laid</p>
			<p class="i0">In her yearning to kiss those dainty lips, while, clutched by her right,</p>
			<p class="i0">Drawn down was his arm, and through swirling eddies he sank from the light.</p>
			<p class="i1">But his cry as he sank was heard of one of his comrades alone</p>
			<p class="i0">Who trod that fountainward path, Polyphemus, Eilatus’ son,</p>
			<p class="i0">To meet that giant hero when back he should fare to the feast.</p>
			<p class="i0">By Pegae, following the cry, hath he rushed, like a wildwood beast</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto whom from far away hath been wafted the bleating of sheep,</p>
			<p class="i0">And with famine afire he pursueth; howbeit he may not leap</p>
			<p class="i0">On the prey, for already the shepherds have penned them safe from the foe;</p>
			<p class="i0">And in vehement rage must he moan and howl, till aweary he grow;</p>
			<p class="i0">So Eilatus’ son made vehement moan, and he roamed to and fro</p>
			<p class="i0">About the place; and his voice rang piteous, broken with woe.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then suddenly drew he his mighty blade, and he rushed to pursue,</p>
			<p class="i0">If perchance he were seized of beasts, or from ambush a robber-crew</p>
			<p class="i0">Had leapt on him faring alone, and were haling afar their prey.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then, even as he shook in his hand his naked sword, in the way</p>
			<p class="i0">Came Herakles’ self to meet him, a giant form that sped</p>
			<p class="i0">To the ship through the gloom; and he knew him, and straightway a tale most dread</p>
			<p class="i0">He told, while laboured with heavy panting his heart, and he said:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘God help thee, that I first bring to thee tidings of bitter pain!</p>
			<p class="i0">Hylas hath gone to the spring, and returned not alive again!</p>
			<p class="i0">Or robbers have seized him, and hale him away to captivity,</p>
			<p class="i0">Or evil beasts are rending:⁠—I heard but now his cry.’</p>
			<p class="i1">Upon Herakles’ temples then did the great sweat-gouts upstart,</p>
			<p class="i0">As he heard him speak, and the dark blood curdled about his heart.</p>
			<p class="i0" id="fix_b1_l1263a">In fury he flung to the earth the pine, and along that path</p>
			<p class="i0">Rushed, whithersoever his feet might hurry his aimless wrath.</p>
			<p class="i0">And as, stung by a gadfly, a bull rusheth onward frenzy-stirred</p>
			<p class="i0">Forsaking the meadows and marshlands, the while of herdsman or herd</p>
			<p class="i0">He taketh no heed, pressing on in his wild course now without check,</p>
			<p class="i0">Now making a moment’s stand, and uplifting his massive neck,</p>
			<p class="i0">He uttereth bellowings, mad with the sting of the cruel breese;</p>
			<p class="i0">So he in his frenzy now would be plying his strong swift knees</p>
			<p class="i0">Unresting, and now from his toil would he cease for a moment’s space,</p>
			<p class="i0">And shouted:⁠—the mighty voice rang far through the lonely place.</p>
			<p class="i1">Eftsoons the morning-star rose over the mountain’s crest,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the winds swept down from the gorges; and Tiphys cried on the rest</p>
			<p class="i0">To get them aboard in haste, and to hearken the wind’s behest.</p>
			<p class="i0">So with eager speed they embarked, and the anchor-stones of the ship</p>
			<p class="i0">Heaved they aboard, and the hawsers thereof in haste did they slip.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the midst of the sail bellied out with the blast, and far away</p>
			<p class="i0">From the sea-strand with joy by Poseidon’s foreland wafted were they.</p>
			<p class="i0">But it fell, in the hour when the dawn glad-eyed from the heaven doth beam,</p>
			<p class="i0">From the east uprising, and all the earth-ways clearer gleam,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the dewy wolds are a-sparkle beneath her flashing sheen,</p>
			<p class="i0">Then were they ware of those that forsaken unwares had been.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then mighty contention arose, and an indignation-burst</p>
			<p class="i0">Most vehement-fierce, that any should go, and forsake the first</p>
			<p class="i0">Of their comrades in prowess. But Aison’s son distraught with amaze</p>
			<p class="i0">Spake never a word or bad or good in their evil case;</p>
			<p class="i0">But devouring his soul he sat ’neath wilderment’s heavy load.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then Telamon’s wrath waxed hot, and thus with the prince he chode:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Ha! sit thou there at thine ease!⁠—good sooth, for thy profit was this,</p>
			<p class="i0">That Herakles thus should be left; thou givest no counsel, I wis,</p>
			<p class="i0">Lest haply his glory in Hellas should overshadow thee,</p>
			<p class="i0">If the Gods peradventure vouchsafe us the home-return to see!⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">What pleasure in words?⁠—I will go, I only, with none of these</p>
			<p class="i0">Thy comrades, who plotted with thee this treason to Herakles.’</p>
			<p class="i1">He spake, and on Tiphys Hagnias’ son he rushed, and his ire</p>
			<p class="i0">Gleamed through his eyes as the leaping flame of the ravening fire.</p>
			<p class="i0">And now to the land of the Mysian men had they won back again</p>
			<p class="i0">In despite of the driving surge, and the head-wind’s ceaseless strain;</p>
			<p class="i0">But the two winged sons of Thracian Boreas rose thereupon,</p>
			<p class="i0">And with fierce stern words from his purpose withheld they Aiakus’ son.</p>
			<p class="i0">Unhappy they!⁠—grim vengeance thereafter did Herakles wreak</p>
			<p class="i0">Upon these who withheld the rest which were fain for the lost to seek.</p>
			<p class="i0">For when from the games over Pelias dead they were wending again</p>
			<p class="i0">Homeward, in Tenos the sea-girt he slew them; and heaped o’er the slain</p>
			<p class="i0">The earth, and above that grave-mound reared he pillars twain,</p>
			<p class="i0">The one whereof, a marvel exceeding for men to behold,</p>
			<p class="i0">Sways to and fro in the blast when the North-wind whistleth cold.</p>
			<p class="i0">Ay, so in the after-time these things were ordained to be.</p>
			<p class="i0">But now did Glaukus appear unto them from the depths of the sea,</p>
			<p class="i0">The servant of Nereus divine, the far-discerning seer.</p>
			<p class="i0">High out of the waves his shaggy head and his breast did he rear</p>
			<p class="i0">Even to the waist, and his brawny hand did the God stretch out</p>
			<p class="i0">To the keel of the ship, and unto her eager crew did he shout:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Wherefore be ye thus purposed against great Zeus’ decrees</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto Aiêtes’ city to bring bold Herakles?</p>
			<p class="i0">Lo, this is his weird⁠—in the land of Argos labouring</p>
			<p class="i0">To accomplish toils full twelve for Eurystheus the tyrannous king,</p>
			<p class="i0">And to dwell with the Deathless Ones, if he bring to fulfilment yet</p>
			<p class="i0">A few more toils: grieve ye not therefore with vain regret.</p>
			<p class="i0">Polyphemus’ weird likewise is to rear, where Kios doth fall</p>
			<p class="i0">Into the sea, ’mid the Mysians a glorious city’s wall,</p>
			<p class="i0">And to find in the Chalybes’ land the doom that endeth all.</p>
			<p class="i0">But Hylas a Goddess-nymph of her love for her spouse hath taken,</p>
			<p class="i0">For whose sake wandered away those twain unawares forsaken.’</p>
			<p class="i1">Then downward he plunged, and he wrapped him about with the waves white-wreathing,</p>
			<p class="i0">And around him the darkling water foamed in eddies seething.</p>
			<p class="i0">And he loosed from his hand the hollow ship through the brine to flee;</p>
			<p class="i0">And the heroes were glad: then rose up Telamon hastily,</p>
			<p class="i0">And Aiakus’ son unto Jason strode, and his hand did he take</p>
			<p class="i0">In the compassing grasp of his own, and embraced him, and thus he spake:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Be nowise wroth with me, Aison’s son, if folly-distraught</p>
			<p class="i0">I have sinned in mine ignorance: anguish exceeding upon me hath wrought</p>
			<p class="i0">To utter an arrogant word which I could not refrain: let us cast</p>
			<p class="i0">To the winds my transgression, and knit be our hearts as in days overpast.’</p>
			<p class="i1">Answered him Aison’s son, and in courteous wise spake he:</p>
			<p class="i0">‘Ah, friend, of a truth ’twas a bitter word that thou spakest to me,</p>
			<p class="i0">When thou saidst in the midst of us all that a traitor I was unto him</p>
			<p class="i0">Who to me was a friend!⁠—yet I will not nurse wrath brooding grim,</p>
			<p class="i0">Though vexed was my soul at the first; since not as for flocks of sheep</p>
			<p class="i0">Didst thou chafe and wast wroth, nor for hoarded wealth of a treasure-heap,</p>
			<p class="i0">But all for a comrade’s sake. I were fain thou wouldst champion so</p>
			<p class="i0">Even me, if need should be ever, against another foe.’</p>
			<p class="i1">He spake, and they sat them down, as in days overpast made one.</p>
			<p class="i0">But their lost⁠—by the counsel of Zeus, Polyphemus Eilatus’ son</p>
			<p class="i0">Was doomed mid the Mysian men to build a city, to bear</p>
			<p class="i0">The name of the river thereby: but aback must Herakles fare</p>
			<p class="i0">At Eurystheus’ labours to toil. But he threatened in anger hot</p>
			<p class="i0">To waste the Mysian land, if her folk for him found not</p>
			<p class="i0">What doom upon Hylas had lighted, if dead or alive he were.</p>
			<p class="i0">And pledges they gave for the lost, in that sons most noble and fair</p>
			<p class="i0">Of their people they chose, and for hostages gave, and an oath they swore</p>
			<p class="i0">That they would not refrain from the toil of the search for evermore.</p>
			<p class="i0">Wherefore for tidings of Hylas the Kians unto this day,</p>
			<p class="i0">For Theiodamas’ son, of the stranger inquire: the warders aye</p>
			<p class="i0">Guard Trêchis the fair-built; for there did the hero cause to abide</p>
			<p class="i0">The sons that they sent for their ransom to turn his fury aside.</p>
			<p class="i1">And the wind all day bare onward the galley and all night through</p>
			<p class="i0">With a fresh strong blast: but when dawning arose, the breath of it blew</p>
			<p class="i0">No whit any more; and they spied jutting forth from a curve of the land</p>
			<p class="i0">A foreland, and broad to behold that dark height swelled from the strand.</p>
			<p class="i0">So they bent to the oars, and at sunrise the keel up-furrowed the sand.</p>
