			<h3 id="book4">THE FOURTH BOOK</h3>
			<p class="i0"><span class="sc">Now</span> take thou up the story, O Goddess of Song, and sing</p>
			<p class="i0">The afflictions and thoughts of the Kolchian maid; for as touching this thing</p>
			<p class="i0">In a tempest of wilderment whirled is my soul, that I know not to say</p>
			<p class="i0">Whether for bitter infatuate passion she fled away</p>
			<p class="i0">From the land of the Kolchian folk, or driven of panic dismay.</p>
			<p class="i1">Now the king in the midst of his Kolchian princes and men of might</p>
			<p class="i0">Against the heroes devising treachery sat through the night</p>
			<p class="i0">In his halls, and hot in his soul did the vehement anger rise</p>
			<p class="i0">For the trial whose issue he loathed, and he weened not in any wise</p>
			<p class="i0">That unhelped of his daughters had Jason prevailed that task to fulfil.</p>
			<p class="i1">But Medea’s spirit did Hêrê with woefullest anguish thrill:</p>
			<p class="i0">And she quaked like a fawn light-footed, the which the hounds’ deep bay</p>
			<p class="i0">Hath scared, the while in the tangled depths of a copse she lay.</p>
			<p class="i0">For straightway she surely foreboded that nothing concealed should remain</p>
			<p class="i0">Of her help, and for this should she fill up a cup of uttermost bane.</p>
			<p class="i0">And her maids which were privy thereto she dreaded, and filled were her eyes</p>
			<p class="i0">With fire, and the ears of her rang with a sound as of awful cries.</p>
			<p class="i0">And ofttimes she clutched at her throat, and moaned in her wretched despair,</p>
			<p class="i0">As once and again she rent the tresses of her hair.</p>
			<p class="i0">And there had the maiden beyond her weird her own death wrought</p>
			<p class="i0">By tasting of poison; and Hêrê’s purpose had come to nought,</p>
			<p class="i0">But for this, that the Goddess stirred her to flee in her panic dread</p>
			<p class="i0">With Phrixus’ sons. So her fluttering spirit was comforted</p>
			<p class="i0">In her breast; and into her bosom in eager haste did she pour</p>
			<p class="i0">All mingled her spell-drugs and poisons, her casket’s deadly store.</p>
			<p class="i0">And she kissed her bed, and her hands on the walls with loving caress</p>
			<p class="i0">Lingered: she kissed the posts of the doors; and one long tress</p>
			<p class="i0">She severed, and left it her bower within, for her mother to be</p>
			<p class="i0">A memorial of maidenhood’s days, and with passionate voice moaned she:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘This tress in mine own stead leave I, or ever I go, unto thee,</p>
			<p class="i0">My mother; and, far though I wend, yet take farewell from me!</p>
			<p class="i0">Farewell thou, Chalkiopê, and mine home!⁠—Would God that the wave,</p>
			<p class="i0">Ere thou cam’st to the Kolchian land, O stranger, had yawned for thy grave!’</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake she, and down from her eyelids in floods the teardrops ran.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then, even as stealeth forth from the house of a wealthy man</p>
			<p class="i0">A bondmaid, whom fate but newly hath torn from her fatherland-soil,</p>
			<p class="i0">Who never till now hath tasted the lot of bitter toil,</p>
			<p class="i0">But unschooled to misery, shrinking in horror from slavery</p>
			<p class="i0">Under the cruel hands of a mistress, forth doth she flee;</p>
			<p class="i0">Even so from her home forth hasted the lovely maid that day.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, and the bolts of the doors self-moving to her gave way</p>
			<p class="i0">Leaping aback at the swift-breathed spell of her magic song.</p>
			<p class="i0">And with feet unsandalled she ran the narrow lanes along,</p>
			<p class="i0">While her left hand gathered a fold of her mantle, to screen from sight</p>
			<p class="i0">Her brows and her face and her lovely cheeks, the while with her right</p>
			<p class="i0">The hem of the skirt of her tunic she held upraised from the ground.</p>
			<p class="i0">And swiftly without the towers that girded the wide burg round</p>
			<p class="i0">By the darkling path in her terror she came; and no man knew</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the warders thereof, but past them all unseen she flew.</p>
			<p class="i0">Thence marked she well to the temple the way, nor unweeting she was</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the path, for that oft thereby in her questing she wont to pass</p>
			<p class="i0">Seeking for corpses and deadly roots, as the wont is still</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the sorceress. Ever with quivering dread did the heart of her thrill.</p>
			<p class="i0">And Titania beheld her, as upward she floated from heaven’s far bourne,</p>
			<p class="i0">As she wandered distraught; and the white Moon-goddess in triumph-scorn</p>
			<p class="i0">Over Medea exulted, and thus to her heart ’gan say:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Ha, not I only adown to the Latmian cavern stray,</p>
			<p class="i0">Nor I alone for Endymion the comely with love am afire!</p>
			<p class="i0">Ha, many a time when mine heart was yearning with hot desire,</p>
			<p class="i0">Did thy strong spells drive me from heaven, that thou in the rayless night</p>
			<p class="i0">Unhindered might’st work thy sorceries, deeds that are aye thy delight.</p>
			<p class="i0">Now thou too hast part in the same infatuate passion, I trow,</p>
			<p class="i0">And a god of affliction hath made this Jason a torment and woe</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto thee! Pass on, and harden thine heart, be thou never so wise,</p>
			<p class="i0">To take up thy burden of anguish, thy doom full-fraught with sighs.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake she; but swiftly the maid’s feet bare her, as onward she strained;</p>
			<p class="i0">And glad was she when the height of the bank of the river she gained.</p>
			<p class="i0">And overagainst her beheld the splendour of fire: nightlong</p>
			<p class="i0">For joy of the trial triumphant they fed it, the hero-throng.</p>
			<p class="i0">And she lifted her voice clear-pealing: across the darkness she cried:</p>
			<p class="i0">To the youngest of Phrixus’ children she called from the farther side,</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto Phrontis: and he with his brother discerned Medea’s call;</p>
			<p class="i0">And the son of Aison knew it; and hushed were the heroes all</p>
			<p class="i0">In amazement, so soon as they knew of a certainty whose was the cry.</p>
			<p class="i0">Thrice called she aloud, and thrice, as his company bade reply,</p>
			<p class="i0">Phrontis in answer shouted, the while with swift-plied oar</p>
			<p class="i0">The heroes were rowing their ship unto where she stood on the shore.</p>
			<p class="i0">Not yet to the land were they casting the hawsers forth of the ship,</p>
			<p class="i0">When lo! to the shore with feet light-bounding did Jason leap</p>
			<p class="i0">From the height of the deck-planks; and after him Phrontis to land hath sprung,</p>
			<p class="i0">And Argus, the children of Phrixus. About their knees she clung,</p>
			<p class="i0">Clasping them round with clinging hands, and Medea cried:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Deliver me, O my friends, the hapless!⁠—yea, and beside</p>
			<p class="i0">Save from Aiêtes yourselves: for all hath been brought to light,</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, all: and there cometh no help therefor. But speed we our flight</p>
			<p class="i0">In your ship, ere the king shall have mounted his swift-horsed car for the chase.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the Fleece of Gold will I give you: with slumber-spells will I daze</p>
			<p class="i0">Its serpent warder. But thou in thy comrades’ presence take</p>
			<p class="i0">The Gods to witness the vows which thy lips, O stranger, spake</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto me: neither make me, when hence I have fled and afar from my land,</p>
			<p class="i0">An outcast dishonoured, as one by whose side no kinsman doth stand.’</p>
			<p class="i1">In anguish she spake: but with gladness exceeding the heart ’gan stir</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Aison’s son. At his knees as she bowed, he uplifted her</p>
			<p class="i0">Gently, and straightway embraced her, and spake to her words of cheer:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Lady, let Zeus himself the Olympian my troth-plight hear;</p>
			<p class="i0">Let Hêrê of Wedlock, the Bride of Zeus, in witness be near,</p>
			<p class="i0">That I surely will make thee mine own true wife mine halls within</p>
			<p class="i0">Whensoever returning again unto Hellas-land I shall win.’</p>
			<p class="i1">He spake, and her hand with his right hand caught in the clasp of love.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then did the maiden bid them to speed to the sacred grove</p>
			<p class="i0">The swift ship straightway, that so, ere Aiêtes was ware, they might seize</p>
			<p class="i0">And bear away in the darkness of night the Golden Fleece.</p>
			<p class="i0">Even with the word was the deed performed by the eager men;</p>
			<p class="i0">For they took her aboard, and forth from the land their galley then</p>
			<p class="i0">Thrust they: with plashing loud the pinewood oars ’gan strain</p>
			<p class="i0">In the hands of the chieftains. But backward darting the maiden again</p>
			<p class="i0">Outstretched her despairing hands to the shore: but Jason spake</p>
			<p class="i0">Comforting words, and restrained her whose heart went nigh to break.</p>
			<p class="i1">In the hour when men from their eyes the fetters of slumber cast,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even huntsmen, which put their trust in their hounds, nor ever waste</p>
			<p class="i0">In slumber the end of the night, but the light of the sun they prevent,</p>
			<p class="i0">Lest, ere they be forth, he efface the track of the beasts, and the scent</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the quarry, with stainless-gleaming shafts down-smiting thereon;</p>
			<p class="i0">Even then with the maid from the galley forth stepped Aison’s son</p>
			<p class="i0">On a grassy sward. The Couch of the Ram men call that spot,</p>
			<p class="i0">For that there he rested first his knees with toil overwrought,</p>
			<p class="i0">As he bare on his back the Minyan scion of Athamas.</p>
			<p class="i0">And anigh it all smoke-besmirched the base of an altar there was,</p>
			<p class="i0">Which the Aiolid Phrixus to Zeus the Preserver of Exiles did build,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the Golden Marvel offered thereon, as, gracious-willed,</p>
			<p class="i0">Hermes bade, in the way as he met him. The hero-crew</p>
			<p class="i0">There set them aland, as Argus gave them counsel to do.</p>
			<p class="i0">So these twain fared by the pathway that led to the sacred grove,</p>
			<p class="i0">Seeking the oak-tree marvellous-huge, mid the branches whereof</p>
			<p class="i0">Was hanging the Fleece, like a morning-cloud that flusheth red</p>
			<p class="i0">In the beams of the sun as he riseth up from his ocean-bed.</p>
			<p class="i0">But barring their path did the neck exceeding long uprise</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the serpent glaring upon them with keen unsleeping eyes</p>
			<p class="i0">As they came; and in awful wise did he hiss; and the banks of the flood</p>
			<p class="i0">Far-stretching echoed, and sighed the measureless depths of the wood.</p>
			<p class="i0">The people that dwell from Titanian Aia far away</p>
			<p class="i0">In the Kolchian land by the outfall of Lykus heard, even they⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Lykus, which parteth his flow from Araxes’ rattle and roar,</p>
			<p class="i0">And blendeth with Phasis his sacred stream, and these twain pour</p>
			<p class="i0">Their mingled waters in one to the dark Caucasian sea.</p>
			<p class="i0">Young mothers in terror awoke, and their hands in agony</p>
			<p class="i0">Cast they around their babes new-born, in their arms which slept,</p>
			<p class="i0">As the tiny limbs with the horror of that hiss thrilled and leapt.</p>
			<p class="i0">And even as when, above a smouldering faggot-pile,</p>
			<p class="i0">The eddies of smoke roll upward in murky coil on coil,</p>
			<p class="i0">One after another swiftly ever on high they spring</p>
			<p class="i0">From beneath in wavering wreaths uprushing and hovering;</p>
			<p class="i0">Even so that monster was writhing and heaving the endless trail</p>
			<p class="i0">Of his coils overlapped with the myriad-ranged harsh-crackling scale.</p>
			<p class="i0">But, even as he writhed him, came before his eyes the maid,</p>
			<p class="i0">With sweet voice summoning Sleep, most mighty of Gods, to her aid,</p>
			<p class="i0">On the monster to cast his spell: and to her that through night’s deep mirk</p>
			<p class="i0">Paceth, the Underworld Queen, she cried to speed her work.</p>
			<p class="i0">And followed her Aison’s son in fear: but, lulled by the song,</p>
			<p class="i0">The serpent by this was relaxing the thorn-ridge endless-long</p>
			<p class="i0">Of his Titan-spires, and was lengthening out his coils untold,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even as a dark wave over a sluggish sea slow-rolled,</p>
			<p class="i0">A dumb and a thunderless surge: yet still, in despite of the spell,</p>
			<p class="i0">His grisly head he uplifted on high, with purpose fell</p>
			<p class="i0">To encompass the twain with the grip of his murderous jaws: but she,</p>
			<p class="i0">Dipping the newly-slivered spray of a juniper-tree</p>
			<p class="i0">In her mystic brewis, singing⁠—singing⁠—rained down fast</p>
			<p class="i0">Untempered spells on his eyne, and about him and o’er him was cast</p>
			<p class="i0">Sleep by the drug’s strong fume; and his dragon-jaws he laid</p>
			<p class="i0">On the earth in the selfsame place, and his endless coils through the shade</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the myriad stems of the forest stretching afar were unrolled.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then from the oak-tree the hero snatched the Fleece of Gold</p>
			<p class="i0">At the maiden’s bidding. Unswerving all the while she stayed</p>
			<p class="i0">And smeared on the head of the monster her unguent, till Jason bade,</p>
			<p class="i0">Till himself said, ‘Turn we again, and fare to the galley aback.’</p>
			<p class="i0">Then left she the War-god’s grove, where the vast shades brooded black.</p>
			<p class="i0">And even as a maiden may catch on her vesture of delicate thread</p>
			<p class="i0">The light of the mid-month’s moon, when she saileth the heavens overhead</p>
			<p class="i0">Her high-roofed bridal bower, and her heart in her breast is aglow</p>
			<p class="i0">With joy that her eyes behold that lovely splendour; so</p>
			<p class="i0">Exulting did Jason the mighty Fleece in his hands upraise.</p>
			<p class="i0">And suddenly over his forehead and over his sunburnt face</p>
			<p class="i0">From its shimmering flocks there rested a flush that flamelike shined.</p>
			<p class="i0">And great as the hide of a yearling steer, or the fell of a hind</p>
			<p class="i0">That is callèd a brocket in speech of the hunters of the wold,</p>
			<p class="i0">So great was its length and its breadth all overtufted with gold,</p>
			<p class="i0">Heavy with flocks thick-clustered; and ever as onward he passed</p>
			<p class="i0">From under his feet the earth an answering sheen upcast.</p>
			<p class="i0">Now veiling the man’s left shoulder the gleaming burden shone</p>
			<p class="i0">Down-trailed from the height of his neck to his heel as he trod, and anon</p>
			<p class="i0">Did he gather it up in his clutch, for that sorely he feared the while</p>
			<p class="i0">Lest a God or a man might meet him and wrest from his hands the spoil.</p>
			<p class="i1">Dawn over the earth was spread, and now those twain returned</p>
			<p class="i0">To their company. Marvelled the youths to behold how the great Fleece burned</p>
			<p class="i0">A splendour as lightning of Zeus. Upsprang they, for eager-keen</p>
			<p class="i0">Was each man to touch the glory, and clasp it his hands between.</p>
			<p class="i0">But the son of Aison withheld them: a mantle thereover he threw</p>
			<p class="i0">New-woven, to hide it. To Argo’s stern the maiden he drew,</p>
			<p class="i0">And he seated her there; and he spake to the heroes all his rede:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘No longer forbear now, friends, to your fatherland homeward to speed:</p>
			<p class="i0">For the emprise now for the which we dared the peril and pain</p>
			<p class="i0">Of a desperate voyage, toiling with bitter travail and strain,</p>
			<p class="i0">All this by the maiden’s counsels lightly hath been fulfilled.</p>
			<p class="i0">To the home-land her will I bring⁠—yea, so herself hath willed⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">My bride true-wedded: but ye, forasmuch as the saviour she is</p>
			<p class="i0">Of all Achaia-land, and of your own souls, I wis,</p>
			<p class="i0">Save her; for surely, I ween, will Aiêtes with all his array</p>
			<p class="i0">Go forth, with intent from the river seaward to bar our way.</p>
			<p class="i0">Now down through the ship, man ranged after man in order arow,</p>
			<p class="i0">Shall the half of you sit at the oars to toil, that the half of you so</p>
			<p class="i0">May uplift the ox-hide shields for a fence from the darts of the foe,</p>
			<p class="i0">Guarding our home-return. Lo, now in our hands do we bear</p>
			<p class="i0">Our children, our fatherland dearly-beloved, and the silver hair</p>
			<p class="i0">Of our sires; and with this our venture the fate of Hellas is bound,</p>
			<p class="i0">Or to reap confusion of face, or a glory far-renowned.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake he, and donned his harness of fight; and shouted the crew</p>
			<p class="i0">With wondrous-eager souls; and forth of the scabbard he drew</p>
			<p class="i0">His sword, and the ship’s stern-hawsers he severed in twain with the brand.</p>
			<p class="i0">And hard by the maiden, in armour clad, hath he taken his stand</p>
			<p class="i0">By Ankaius the helmsman, and flashed the oars as the good ship raced,</p>
			<p class="i0">As to speed her forth of the river they strained in desperate haste.</p>
			<p class="i1">But by this to Aiêtes the king and to all the Kolchians known</p>
			<p class="i0">Was Medea’s love, and revealed were all the deeds she had done.</p>
			<p class="i0">And they swarmed to the gathering-place in their harness of battle, untold</p>
			<p class="i0">As the crested waves of the sea by the stormy wind uprolled,</p>
			<p class="i0">Or as leaves of the forest myriad-branched that earthward sail</p>
			<p class="i0">In the month of the fall of the leaf⁠—whereof who telleth the tale?</p>
			<p class="i0">So numberless these went pouring the banks of the river along</p>
			<p class="i0">With frenzy of shouting: on fair-fashioned chariot amidst of the throng</p>
			<p class="i0">Glorious Aiêtes showed above all with his steeds, the gift</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the Sun-god; for even as the blasts of the wind were they passing-swift.</p>
			<p class="i0">In his left hand his shapely-rounded buckler on high did he rear,</p>
			<p class="i0">And a pine-brand exceeding huge in his right: and his giant spear</p>
			<p class="i0">Beside him rose up straight and high; and the reins of the car</p>
			<p class="i0">Absyrtus grasped in his hands. But Argo by this was afar</p>
			<p class="i0">Cleaving the brine, to the stalwart oarsmen’s stroke as she leapt</p>
			<p class="i0">By the down-rushing flood of the mighty river seaward swept.</p>
			<p class="i0">But the king in a madness of anguish uplifted his hands to the sky:</p>
			<p class="i0">To the Sun and to Zeus, the beholders of evil deeds, did he cry;</p>
			<p class="i0">And he turned him to all his host, and he shouted terribly:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Except ye lay hands on the maiden, and seize, or on land it may be,</p>
			<p class="i0">Or finding their ship yet tossed on the swell of the open sea,</p>
			<p class="i0">And bring her, that so I may glut my fury, wherewith I burn</p>
			<p class="i0">For revenge, on your own heads all these things shall light: ye shall learn</p>
			<p class="i0">The measure of all my wrath and all my revenging then.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake Aiêtes: on that same day did the Kolchian men</p>
			<p class="i0">Launch forth their galleys, and cast in the ships their tackling-array,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the selfsame day sailed forth on the sea: thou wouldst not say</p>
			<p class="i0">That so mighty a host was this of ships, but in crowd on crowd</p>
			<p class="i0">The nations of bird-folk over the sea were clamouring loud.</p>
			<p class="i1">Swiftly the wind blew, even as Hêrê the Goddess planned,</p>
			<p class="i0">To the end that Aiaian Medea might reach the Pelasgian land</p>
			<p class="i0">Right soon, that in her might the bane of Pelias’ house be found.</p>
			<p class="i0">So the men with the third day’s dawn the hawsers of Argo bound</p>
			<p class="i0">To the Paphlagons’ strand, where the sea and the waters of Halys meet:</p>
			<p class="i0">For Medea bade them to land, and with sacrifice to entreat</p>
			<p class="i0">Hekatê’s grace. What things for that incantation of hell</p>
			<p class="i0">The maiden prepared and offered, thereof let no man tell.</p>
			<p class="i0">Let my spirit enkindle me not to darken therewith my lay!</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, awe refraineth my lips. Yet the altar on that far day</p>
			<p class="i0">To the Goddess upreared by the heroes hard by the breaking sea</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet standeth, a sign to be seen of the children of days to be.</p>
			<p class="i1">Straightway to Aison’s son, and the heroes withal, came back</p>
			<p class="i0">Remembrance of Phineus, and how that he spake of another track</p>
			<p class="i0">To be found from Aia: howbeit to all was his meaning dim,</p>
			<p class="i0">Till Argus arose and spake, and eager they hearkened to him:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘We may win to Orchomenus, whither the prophecy bade us fare</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the seer unerring, whose guests in the days overpast ye were.</p>
			<p class="i0">For another voyaging-course there is, a sea-path shown</p>
			<p class="i0">By the priests of the Deathless, the sons of Thêbê, Tritonis’ town.</p>
			<p class="i0">Not yet was the star-host, that whirl round heaven their chariots of fire:</p>
			<p class="i0">Not yet of the sacred Danaan race, though a man should inquire,</p>
			<p class="i0">Aught might he hear. Apidanian Arcadians alone on the earth</p>
			<p class="i0">Dwelt⁠—the Arcadians which lived, or ever the moon had birth,</p>
			<p class="i0">Mid the mountains acorn-sustained, it is told. No sceptred hand</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Deukalion’s glorious line ruled then the Pelasgian land,</p>
			<p class="i0">In the days when men called Egypt, the fruitful land of corn,</p>
			<p class="i0">The Morning-land, the mother of peoples elder-born.</p>
			<p class="i0">And of Trito her fair-flowing river was named, of whom all the plain</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the Morning-land is watered; for never descendeth the rain</p>
			<p class="i0">From Zeus thereupon: from his floods the stintless harvests spring.</p>
			<p class="i0">From that land, say they, a certain king went journeying</p>
			<p class="i0">All Europe and Asia through, by the strength and the prowess made bold</p>
			<p class="i0">And the aweless might of his people, and cities he builded untold</p>
			<p class="i0">Whithersoever he came, whereof some remain to this day,</p>
			<p class="i0">Some not, for that long generations since then have passed away.</p>
			<p class="i0">But Aia abideth unshaken: a nation the sons’ sons yet</p>
			<p class="i0">Abide of the men whose dwelling in Aia the hero set.</p>
			<p class="i0">And graven memorials these men keep of their fathers’ days</p>
			<p class="i0">Upon pillars, whereon is every bourne and all the ways</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the watery waste and the land, as ye journey on all sides round.</p>
			<p class="i0">Now a river, the uttermost horn of the Ocean, therein is found,</p>
			<p class="i0">Wide and exceeding deep, that a dromond may sail the same.</p>
			<p class="i0">Far on their chart have they traced it, and Ister they named its name.</p>
			<p class="i0">And awhile through the boundless tilthland it cleaveth its way afar</p>
			<p class="i0">As but one; for beyond the North-wind’s blasts its fountains are,</p>
			<p class="i0">Where midst the Rhipaian mountains it bursteth forth in thunder:</p>
			<p class="i0">But so soon as it parteth the Thracian and Scythian marches asunder,</p>
			<p class="i0">There is it cleft in twain, and the half of its flood it sendeth</p>
			<p class="i0">Hereby to the sea Ionian, the residue southward trendeth</p>
			<p class="i0">Where a deep gulf up from the sea Trinacrian northward bendeth⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">That sea which lieth beside your land, if the tale be true</p>
			<p class="i0">That forth of your land Acheloüs the river fleeteth thereto.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake he; and sent by the Goddess a happy portent came;</p>
			<p class="i0">And all they looking thereunto hailed it with joyful acclaim</p>
			<p class="i0">For a sign that their voyaging-track was this: for a splendour in heaven</p>
			<p class="i0">Shone in a far-stretching furrow to point where their path was given.</p>
			<p class="i0">And there glad-hearted they left the son of Lykus, and fled</p>
			<p class="i0">With wide-spread canvas over the sea, looking back as they sped</p>
			<p class="i0">On the Paphlagonian Hills, neither rounded Karambis-head,</p>
			<p class="i0">Forasmuch as the breezes held, and the heavenly fire’s long gleam</p>
			<p class="i0">Shone ever before, till they won unto Ister’s mighty stream.</p>
			<p class="i1">Now the rest of the Kolchian host, when nothing their search availed,</p>
			<p class="i0">Forth through the Crags Dark-blue from the Pontus-sea had sailed.</p>
			<p class="i0">But others went to the river, whose chieftain Absyrtus was;</p>
			<p class="i0">And unto the Fair Mouth turning aside from the sea did he pass,</p>
			<p class="i0">And prevented them, mooring beyond the neck of land that ran</p>
			<p class="i0">Athwart the innermost gulf of the sea Ionian.</p>
			<p class="i0">For around the island Peukê the waters of Ister pour,</p>
			<p class="i0">An isle three-cornered, whose breadth looketh out on the breakers hoar,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the narrow point up-stream, and about it the flood’s outfall</p>
			<p class="i0">Is cleft in twain; and the one the passage of Narex they call;</p>
			<p class="i0">And that on the nether side the Fair Mouth: even thereby</p>
			<p class="i0">The Kolchian array with Absyrtus anchored hastily;</p>
			<p class="i0">While the heroes sailed far up to the uttermost spur of the isle.</p>
			<p class="i0">Now the field-abiding shepherds forsook in the meadows the while</p>
			<p class="i0">Flocks without number, for dread of the ships; for they weened that these</p>
			<p class="i0">Were beasts that had risen out of the monster-teeming seas.</p>
			<p class="i0">For never on galleys that ride the waves had they gazed ere then,</p>
			<p class="i0">Nor they, nor the Thracian Scythians, nor yet the Sigynian men,</p>
			<p class="i0">Nor yet the Graukenian folk, nor the Sindian tribes that abide</p>
			<p class="i0">Round Laurium now, on the steppes of the wilderness boundless-wide.</p>
			<p class="i0">But when they had run by Angurus, the Kauliac cliffs withal⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Afar from Angurus the mountain riseth their long rock-wall⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Around which Ister divideth, and this way and that way run</p>
			<p class="i0">His rushing waters, and out to the Laurian plain they won,</p>
			<p class="i0">Then forth to the Kronian Sea the Kolchians came, and beset</p>
			<p class="i0">All the outgoings thereof, that the quarry might ’scape not their net.</p>
			<p class="i0">So Argo, descending behind them the flood, passed forth hard by</p>
			<p class="i0">Where islands twain, the Brygêïan Isles of Artemis, lie.</p>
			<p class="i0">Now it fell that in one of these a hallowed temple stood;</p>
			<p class="i0">In the other the heroes, avoiding Absyrtus’ multitude</p>
			<p class="i0">Landed, seeing the foe had left those twin isles void</p>
			<p class="i0">Of their host, for awe of the Daughter of Zeus; but all beside,</p>
			<p class="i0">Thronged with the Kolchian men, barred every seaward way.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, too, of their host upon other isles hard by left they</p>
			<p class="i0">Which betwixt the Nestian land and Salanko the river lay.</p>
			<p class="i1">There, being few against many, that day had the Minyan men</p>
			<p class="i0">Yielded in that grim fight to their foes: howbeit ere then</p>
			<p class="i0">Made they a covenant, fain that the strife should abide unstriven.</p>
			<p class="i0">For the Golden Fleece⁠—forasmuch as Aiêtes’ pledge had been given</p>
			<p class="i0">To the heroes therefor, if the ordeal they dared, and accomplished the toil⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">That prize should they keep, as lawfully won; yea, whether their guile</p>
			<p class="i0">Or their strength in the king’s despite had prevailed that splendour to win.</p>
			<p class="i0">But as touching Medea⁠—for stubborn the wrangling waxed herein⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto Lêto’s Daughter, aloof from the throng, should they give her in ward,</p>
			<p class="i0">Till her cause should be judged of a king, some justice-dispensing lord,</p>
			<p class="i0">Whether he doom that they yield her up to return to the home</p>
			<p class="i0">Of her father, or doom her to Hellas-land with the heroes to come.</p>
			<p class="i1">Now so soon as the maiden mused upon all things purposed of these,</p>
			<p class="i0">With keen-thrilling anguish her heart was tempest-tossed without cease:</p>
			<p class="i0">And straightway she called forth Jason aloof from his comrades alone,</p>
			<p class="i0">And she led him away and away, till far apart were they gone:</p>
			<p class="i0">There uttered she speech all broken with sobs, as she looked in his eyes:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘O Aison’s son, what purpose is this that now ye devise</p>
			<p class="i0">Touching me? Hath thy triumph brought utter forgetfulness unto thee?</p>
			<p class="i0">Dost thou nothing regard thy promises, all that thou spakest to me</p>
			<p class="i0">In stress of thy need? Where now are the oaths of the Suppliants’ King</p>
			<p class="i0">Zeus?⁠—and thine honied promises, whither have these taken wing?</p>
			<p class="i0">By reason of these, in unseemly wise, with passion unshamed</p>
			<p class="i0">I forsook my fatherland home, and the glory of halls far-famed,</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, and my parents⁠—all that was most unto me; and I sail</p>
			<p class="i0">Far over the sea alone, where the plaintive sea-mews wail,</p>
			<p class="i0">Because of thy trouble, that I might redeem from destruction thy life</p>
			<p class="i0">To accomplish the fire-bulls’ quelling, the Earth-born giants’ strife.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, and the very Fleece, for the which ye had sailed to our shore,</p>
			<p class="i0">All by my folly ye won. Foul shame thereby did I pour</p>
			<p class="i0">On womankind! Wherefore, I say, as thy daughter, thy wife, I stand,</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, and thy sister, who follow thee back unto Hellas-land.</p>
			<p class="i0">Oh now with purpose of heart stand by me, neither forsake me</p>
			<p class="i0">Afar and forlorn of thee, to the gathering of kings to betake thee!</p>
			<p class="i0">But in any wise save me; and sealed abide thy solemn vow,</p>
			<p class="i0">Which is plighted, by justice of man and of God; or else do thou</p>
			<p class="i0">Shear, of thy pity, this my throat with thy falchion through,</p>
			<p class="i0">That so for my frenzied love I may reap the guerdon due.</p>
			<p class="i0">O heartless!⁠—if that he doom that my brother’s prey I remain,</p>
			<p class="i0">This king unto whose stern judgment ye now would commit, ye twain,</p>
			<p class="i0">Your cruel covenant, how shall I come to my father’s sight?</p>
			<p class="i0">With glory in sooth!⁠—what revenges, what devilish torment will light</p>
			<p class="i0">Upon me!⁠—what agony-cup shall I drain for the dreadful deed</p>
			<p class="i0">That I wrought! Oh, never think that in bliss your return shall speed!</p>
			<p class="i0">Ne’er may the World’s Queen, bride of Zeus, accomplish for thee⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">She in whom thou delightest⁠—this! Then may’st thou remember me</p>
			<p class="i0">When anguish-racked: may the Fleece like a dream fleet away from thine hand</p>
			<p class="i0">Down the wind to the netherworld-gloom! Be thou chased from thy fatherland</p>
			<p class="i0">By the Spirits of Vengeance for me, even after the measure of all</p>
			<p class="i0">That through thy betrayal I suffered! That earthward my curses should fall</p>
			<p class="i0">Unaccomplished, shall God forbid; for a great oath thou hast transgressed,</p>
			<p class="i0">O ruthless! Not long, for all this covenant-plight, at rest</p>
			<p class="i0">From your troubles, on me shall ye wink with the eye, to make me your jest.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake she, seething with vehement rage: fierce-eager was she</p>
			<p class="i0">To fire the ship, and to hew it in pieces utterly,</p>
			<p class="i0">And to hurl herself mid the ravening flame. But, half-adread,</p>
			<p class="i0">Did Jason essay to soothe her with gentle words; and he said:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Ah, lady, forbear: me too this covenant liketh not.</p>
			<p class="i0">Only a little delay from the strife herein have we sought:</p>
			<p class="i0">Such a host of foes like a cloud of fire is on every side</p>
			<p class="i0">For thy sake. Yea, and the folk which in this same land abide</p>
			<p class="i0">Be eager to help Absyrtus, that back again to the hall</p>
			<p class="i0">Of thy sire he may hale thee like to a captive battle-thrall.</p>
			<p class="i0">Howbeit should we in hateful destruction all be slain</p>
			<p class="i0">If we closed in the fight with these; and therein were bitterer pain,</p>
			<p class="i0">If we leave thee a prey no less unto these, and withal we die.</p>
			<p class="i0">But now shall this covenant find us a path of guile, whereby</p>
			<p class="i0">To destroy him. The folk of the land shall not be fain as before</p>
			<p class="i0">To favour the Kolchians in thee, when their king shall be with them no more,</p>
			<p class="i0">He who forsooth as thy champion and brother doth claim thee to-day.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea also, I will not refrain me from matching my might in the fray</p>
			<p class="i0">With the Kolchian men, if then they bar mine homeward way.’</p>
			<p class="i1">For her comfort he spake; but with deadly words did she make reply:</p>
			<p class="i0">‘Give heed now:⁠—it needs must be, when peril and shame are nigh,</p>
			<p class="i0">That we likewise counsel thereafter. Distraught I was at the first</p>
			<p class="i0">In mine error, and god-misguided accomplished desires accurst.</p>
			<p class="i0">Do thou be my shield from the Kolchian spears in the toil of the strife,</p>
			<p class="i0">And I will beguile this man to lay in thine hands his life.</p>
			<p class="i0">He shall come: and with dazzling gifts of welcoming win thou his heart,</p>
			<p class="i0">If I haply persuade the heralds to hold themselves apart,</p>
			<p class="i0">And draw him alone unto me to hearken the thing I would say.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then thou, if this deed be good in thy sight⁠—I say not nay⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Slay him, and meet thereafter the Kolchian men in the fray.’</p>
			<p class="i1">Even so these twain consented, and twined the net of guile</p>
			<p class="i0">For Absyrtus; and many a gift of welcome prepared they the while.</p>
			<p class="i0">And with these a sacred mantle, a woven crimson flame,</p>
			<p class="i0">Gave they, Hypsipylê’s gift. The Graces had fashioned the same</p>
			<p class="i0">For the God Dionysus in sea-girt Dia; and he on his son,</p>
			<p class="i0">Thoas, bestowed it; and this at his fleeing Hypsipylê won.</p>
			<p class="i0">And, with many a lovely marvel, that parting-gift wrought fair</p>
			<p class="i0">She gave unto Aison’s son. Thine hands would linger there</p>
			<p class="i0">Touching, thine eyes beholding, ever unsatisfied.</p>
			<p class="i0">And a scent ambrosial breathed therefrom, since that sweet tide</p>
			<p class="i0">When the King Nysaian himself thereon lay down to rest,</p>
			<p class="i0">With wine and with nectar flushed, lay clasping the beauteous breast</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the maiden the daughter of Minos, who sailed from the Knossian land</p>
			<p class="i0">With Theseus, and there was forsaken of him upon Dia’s strand.</p>
			<p class="i0">And Medea wrought on the heralds⁠—for subtlest speech did she frame</p>
			<p class="i0">To beguile them⁠—when unto the Goddess’s temple Absyrtus came</p>
			<p class="i0">For the covenant’s sake, and when night’s black pall should around them be rolled,</p>
			<p class="i0">To depart, that with him she might plot to take that Fleece of Gold</p>
			<p class="i0">From the heroes, and bearing the prize with him to fare again</p>
			<p class="i0">To Aiêtes’ halls, for that Phrixus’ sons by force had ta’en</p>
			<p class="i0">And had given her unto the strangers a captive to bear overseas.</p>
			<p class="i0">Even so she beguiled them; and wide through the air and afar on the breeze</p>
			<p class="i0">Cast she her witchery-spells, of might to draw from his lair</p>
			<p class="i0">On the trackless mountain the wild beast, lurk he how distant soe’er.</p>
			<p class="i1">Ah, ruthless Love, great grief, great curse to the sons of earth!</p>
			<p class="i0">Of thee fell feuds, and anguish-moans, and laments have birth;</p>
			<p class="i0">From thee therewithal unnumbered woes as a flood forth burst.</p>
			<p class="i0">’Gainst the sons of our foes, thou god, array thee battle-athirst,</p>
			<p class="i0">As when thou didst thrill the heart of Medea with madness accurst!</p>
			<p class="i0">But how, when to meet her he came, by an evil doom did she quell</p>
			<p class="i0">Absyrtus?⁠—for this thing next must the song in order tell.</p>
			<p class="i1">When the heroes had left the maiden on Artemis’ island-strand</p>
			<p class="i0">By the covenant, ran they their ships in a several place aland,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even Kolchians and Minyans. Then to his ambush did Jason hie,</p>
			<p class="i0">For Absyrtus to lie in wait, and for them of his company.</p>
			<p class="i0">And now that hero, deathward-beguiled by their promise dread,</p>
			<p class="i0">Over the swell of the sea in his galley swiftly sped,</p>
			<p class="i0">And under the mirk night stepped on the Isle of the Holy Place,</p>
			<p class="i0">And alone fared onward to meet his sister face to face,</p>
			<p class="i0">And to try her with words⁠—as though some tender child should try</p>
			<p class="i0">A wintertide torrent, when strong men may not cross thereby!⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">If perchance she would weave him a treachery-snare for the stranger-crew.</p>
			<p class="i0">And now were they making agreement for all these things, they two,</p>
			<p class="i0">When suddenly out of the gloom of his ambush the Aisonid leapt</p>
			<p class="i0">Uplifting his naked sword in his hand: and the maiden swept</p>
			<p class="i0">Her veil o’er her eyes, as she turned them away for averting of guilt</p>
			<p class="i0">That she might not behold the blood of her slaughtered brother spilt,</p>
			<p class="i0">And him, as a flesher felleth a strong-horned bull, even so</p>
			<p class="i0">Did he mark him, and smite him, hard by the fane which long ago</p>
			<p class="i0">The Brygians which dwelt on the mainland-shore unto Artemis wrought.</p>
			<p class="i0">In the porchway thereof on his knees he fell; and the hero caught</p>
			<p class="i0">In his hands, as he gasped his latest breath, the dark-red tide</p>
			<p class="i0">As it welled from the gash, and he hurled that murder-rain, that it dyed</p>
			<p class="i0">Crimson her silver veil and her robe, as she shrank aside.</p>
			<p class="i0">And with swift side-glance the all-quelling Vengeance-fiend espied,</p>
			<p class="i0">And her pitiless eye beheld that murderous deed they had done.</p>
			<p class="i0">But the ends of the dead man’s limbs then severed Aison’s son:</p>
			<p class="i0">Thrice licked he the blood from the sod, thrice spat it again to the dust,</p>
			<p class="i0">As the slayer must do that atonement be made for the treachery-thrust.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then hid he the clammy corpse in the ground, where unto this day</p>
			<p class="i0">In the land of Absyrtan men be those bones lapped in clay.</p>
			<p class="i1">Now the heroes the while gazed forth through the night, and beheld where shone</p>
			<p class="i0">The glare of a torch which the maiden upraised for a sign to set on;</p>
			<p class="i0">And alongside the Kolchian galley they laid their ship straightway,</p>
			<p class="i0">And they slaughtered the crew of the Kolchians, even as wild hawks slay</p>
			<p class="i0">The tribes of the woodland cushats, or lions of the wold</p>
			<p class="i0">Drive huddled a mighty flock, when they leap to the midst of the fold.</p>
			<p class="i0">No, of them all was there none that escaped, but on all that throng</p>
			<p class="i0">Even as flame making havoc they rushed; and it seemed o’erlong</p>
			<p class="i0">Ere Jason, afire for their helping, came: no need of his aid</p>
			<p class="i0">Had they; nay rather for him by this were their hearts afraid.</p>
			<p class="i0">Thereafter they sat them down to devise for their voyaging</p>
			<p class="i0">Deep counsel; and, yet as they mused, stole into the midst of the ring</p>
			<p class="i0">The maiden. And Peleus resolved him the first, and he spake the thing:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Now call I upon you to enter up into the ship, and to row</p>
			<p class="i0">Cleaving your sea-path onward, while yet it is night, and the foe</p>
			<p class="i0">Tarry; for when with the dawn they shall see and be ware of their plight,</p>
			<p class="i0">There is no man, I trust me, who, bidding them follow the track of your flight,</p>
			<p class="i0">Shall win them to hearken a word; but, as folk of their king bereft,</p>
			<p class="i0">With grievous dissension shall these, and with faction, asunder be cleft.</p>
			<p class="i0">Wherefore our path henceforward⁠—when sundered our foemen are</p>
			<p class="i0">Each from his fellow⁠—to Hellas home shall be easier far.’</p>
			<p class="i1">He spake, and the young men praised the counsel of Aiakus’ child;</p>
			<p class="i0">And they entered the ship with haste, and they grasped the oars, and they toiled</p>
			<p class="i0">Without rest, till they won by the sacred isle of Elektra⁠—the same</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the eyots is highest⁠—and so to the river Eridanus came.</p>
			<p class="i1">Now the Kolchians, so soon as the doom of their murdered king they knew,</p>
			<p class="i0">Eager were they for Argo to search and her Minyan crew</p>
			<p class="i0">Through all the Kronian Sea: but Hêrê held them back</p>
			<p class="i0">By terrible lightnings that flashed evermore from the cloudy rack,</p>
			<p class="i0">That they shuddered at last when they thought on their homes in Kytaia-land,</p>
			<p class="i0">And quailed for Aiêtes’ wrath, and a king’s avenging hand.</p>
			<p class="i0">So went they ashore, and abiding homes in the land they made</p>
			<p class="i0">Far-scattered; for some set foot on the selfsame isles where stayed</p>
			<p class="i0">The heroes;⁠—the name of Absyrtus yet do the islanders bear;⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">By the river Illyrican’s darkling depths did others rear</p>
			<p class="i0">A tower-girt burg where the tomb of Harmonia and Kadmus doth stand:</p>
			<p class="i0">With Enchelean men do they dwell: and some in the mountain-land</p>
			<p class="i0">Amidst of the ridges abide which the Crests of Thunder they call</p>
			<p class="i0">Since the day when crashed the thunders of Zeus their souls to appal,</p>
			<p class="i0">That they crossed not over the flood to the isle, on the heroes to fall.</p>
			<p class="i1">Now these, when they weened that the home-return’s grim peril was past,</p>
			<p class="i0">Who had gotten so far on now, made Argo’s hawsers fast</p>
			<p class="i0">To the strand Hyllaian; for thick in the river the eyots lie,</p>
			<p class="i0">And a troublous track they make it for them that would voyage thereby.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the folk Hyllaian devised not their hurt, as in that past day:</p>
			<p class="i0">Nay, rather they did their endeavour to help them forth on their way.</p>
			<p class="i0">And they won for their guerdon the mighty tripod Apollo gave.</p>
			<p class="i0">For tripods twain had Phœbus bestowed, far over the wave</p>
			<p class="i0">To be borne in the Quest of Aison’s son, when to Pytho’s shrine</p>
			<p class="i0">He wended, to ask touching this same voyage the purpose divine.</p>
			<p class="i0">And this was their weird, that in whatso land those tripods were placed,</p>
			<p class="i0">That land no foes breaking in thereupon should prevail to waste.</p>
			<p class="i0">Wherefore in that land yet by Hyllê’s pleasant town</p>
			<p class="i0">That tripod abideth, hidden beneath the earth deep down,</p>
			<p class="i0">That the talisman so may continue of men unseen for aye.</p>
			<p class="i0">Howbeit their king no longer alive in the land found they,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even Hyllus, whom Melitê lovely-faced unto Herakles bare</p>
			<p class="i0">In Phaeacia-land; for of old to the halls did the hero fare</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Nausithous and Makris, the nurse of the God Dionysus: defiled</p>
			<p class="i0">With the blood of his children, he came to be cleansed. There saw he the child</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Aigaius the river, even the Naiad Melitê:</p>
			<p class="i0">And he loved her, and humbled the maid, and Hyllus the strong bare she</p>
			<p class="i0">In Phaeacia-land. And he dwelt in Nausithous’ halls awhile,</p>
			<p class="i0">Being yet but a little one: but he left thereafter the isle.</p>
			<p class="i0">For, as waxed within him his might, he brooked no longer to stay</p>
			<p class="i0">At a king’s beck there in the island that owned Nausithous’ sway.</p>
			<p class="i0">But he fared to the Kronian Sea, and a host of her sons forth led</p>
			<p class="i0">From Phaeacia-land: yea, also the king his journeying sped,</p>
			<p class="i0">The hero Nausithous. There did he stablish his home, and was slain</p>
			<p class="i0">Defending his kine from the Mentors, the rovers of the main.</p>
			<p class="i1">Now, Goddesses, tell how Argo’s wondrous ensign came</p>
			<p class="i0">Without this sea, by Ausonia-land, and the isles men name</p>
			<p class="i0">The ‘Long Row,’ lone sea-cradles that nurse a Ligurian seed⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">How stood clear forth mid-sea⁠—what strong constraint, what need</p>
			<p class="i0">Thitherward led her, what breezes they were that wafted her speed.</p>
			<p class="i1">’Twas, I ween, when Absyrtus had fallen in mighty overthrow,</p>
			<p class="i0">That the wrath of Zeus, the King of the Gods, for their deed was aglow.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet he ordained the transgressors to cleanse them of murder’s stain</p>
			<p class="i0">By the counsels of Circê, and so, after measureless travail and pain,</p>
			<p class="i0">Home to return; yet this of the princes did no man know.</p>
			<p class="i0">But they sped, when the land Hyllaian sank on the sea-marge low,</p>
			<p class="i0">Afar; and they left behind them the isles that were thronged erewhile</p>
			<p class="i0">With the Kolchians, isle Liburnian ranged in the sea after isle,</p>
			<p class="i0">Issa, Dyskeladus, then Pityeia’s lovely shore.</p>
			<p class="i0">So passed they these, and overagainst Kerkyra they bore.</p>
			<p class="i0">There was it Poseidon caused Asôpus’ daughter to rest,</p>
			<p class="i0">When by reason of love he wafted Kerkyra the beautiful-tressed</p>
			<p class="i0">From the land of Phlius afar: and mariners marking it swell</p>
			<p class="i0">Blackening up from the sea, while all about it fell</p>
			<p class="i0">The folds of its darkling forests, named it Kerkyra the Black.</p>
			<p class="i0">Thence sped they by Melitê, glad for the breeze blowing soft on their track.</p>
			<p class="i0">By Kerôsus the steep, and, far in the offing and faint as it showed,</p>
			<p class="i0">By Nymphaia they fleeted, the isle where the Lady Kalypso abode,</p>
			<p class="i0">The daughter of Atlas: and misty and doubtful appeared to their ken</p>
			<p class="i0">The Crests of Thunder. And known unto Hêrê even then</p>
			<p class="i0">Were the counsels of Zeus concerning these, and his mighty wrath.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet devised she how that great voyage should prosper, and full in their path</p>
			<p class="i0">Uproused she against them the storm-winds, which caught them, and backward swept</p>
			<p class="i0">To Elektra’s rocky isle. But, from surge unto surge as they leapt,</p>
			<p class="i0">Suddenly heard they a beam with a man’s voice cry unto them</p>
			<p class="i0">Out of the hollow ship, the which in the midst of the stem</p>
			<p class="i0">Athênê had set⁠—it was hewn from an oak in Dodona that grew;</p>
			<p class="i0">And deadliest fear laid hold upon them as they hearkened thereto,</p>
			<p class="i0">To the voice revealing the wrath of Zeus, and the stern decree</p>
			<p class="i0">Which ordained that they should not escape from the paths of an endless sea,</p>
			<p class="i0">And affliction of tempests, till Circê should purge the guilt away</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Absyrtus’ ruthless murder. Moreover the voice bade pray</p>
			<p class="i0">Polydeukes and Kastor withal to the Gods everlasting, to grant</p>
			<p class="i0">First through the Ausonian sea a path to the secret haunt</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Circê, the daughter whom Persê unto the Sun-god bare.</p>
			<p class="i0">So Argo cried through the darkness: uprose that god-born pair,</p>
			<p class="i0">Tyndareus’ sons, and their hands to the deathless Gods did they raise</p>
			<p class="i0">Praying the prayer commanded; but hushed in awed amaze</p>
			<p class="i0">Were the rest of the Minyan heroes. On under canvas, and on,</p>
			<p class="i0">Leapt Argo, till deep within Eridanus’ river they won.</p>
			<p class="i0">There, stricken of old on the breast with the smouldering levin-fire,</p>
			<p class="i0">Phaethon half-consumed from the car of his Sun-god sire</p>
			<p class="i0">Fell into the gulf of the fathomless mere; and the seething stream</p>
			<p class="i0">From his burning wound even yet upbelcheth clouds of steam.</p>
			<p class="i0">Neither across that water outspreading her pinions light</p>
			<p class="i0">Any fowl of the air may win her way, but, even mid-flight</p>
			<p class="i0">Faint-fluttering, down mid the flame it plungeth. On either side</p>
			<p class="i0">Round poplars slim the Sun-god’s daughters in slow dance glide,</p>
			<p class="i0">In misery wailing a piteous plaint, and adown from their eyne</p>
			<p class="i0">Raining to earth do the glittering drops of amber shine.</p>
			<p class="i0">These, parched by the beams of the sun, lie strewn at their feet on the sand;</p>
			<p class="i0">But whensoever the blasts of the wailing wind on the strand</p>
			<p class="i0">Are dashing the dark mere’s surging billows and onward hurling,</p>
			<p class="i0">Then to Eridanus roll they, a huddled throng on-whirling</p>
			<p class="i0">In a rippling stream. Now a legend thereof do the Kelt-folk tell</p>
			<p class="i0">How that these which in eddies be tossed be the tears from Apollo that fell,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even Lêto’s son, which he shed without number in ancient days,</p>
			<p class="i0">What time he came to the Hyperboreans’ sacred race,</p>
			<p class="i0">By his father’s threatenings driven from the sunlit heaven to the earth,</p>
			<p class="i0">Wroth for his son, unto whom Karônis the Nymph gave birth</p>
			<p class="i0">In bright Lakyreia, where Amyrus’ outfall seaward is rolled.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, such is the tale of these that amidst that people is told.</p>
			<p class="i0">And, thereon as they sailed, no care for meat nor for drink had they,</p>
			<p class="i0">Neither turned their thoughts unto gladness; but ever day by day</p>
			<p class="i0">Sorely afflicted they were till their burdened hearts grew faint</p>
			<p class="i0">With the noisome stench that uprose, the unendurable taint</p>
			<p class="i0">From Eridanus’ streams that reeked of Phaethon burning still.</p>
			<p class="i0">And ever by night they hearkened the shriek of the long wail shrill</p>
			<p class="i0">From the Sun-god’s daughters lamenting. Their tears, as they mourned and wept,</p>
			<p class="i0">Like drops from the fruit of the olive adown to the waters were swept.</p>
			<p class="i1">Thence into Rhodanus ran they, whose deep-flowing waters fleet</p>
			<p class="i0">Into Eridanus’ stream: and where the great floods meet,</p>
			<p class="i0">Roar they turmoiling and seething. Now Rhodanus cometh from far,</p>
			<p class="i0">From the ends of the earth, where the portals of Night and her mansions are.</p>
			<p class="i0">Thence bursteth he forth, and divideth his stream; for the one part roareth</p>
			<p class="i0">To the beaches of Ocean, and one to the sea Ionian poureth;</p>
			<p class="i0">And a third to the main Sardinian, the sea-gulf limitless-vast,</p>
			<p class="i0">Through seven mouths sendeth his flood. So from Rhodanus forth they passed,</p>
			<p class="i0">And they drave over wintry meres wide-spread⁠—none telleth their bound⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Over the Keltic mainland, and well-nigh there had they found</p>
			<p class="i0">Inglorious doom: for a certain branch turns sidewards flowing</p>
			<p class="i0">To the Ocean-gulf; thereinto were these, of the peril unknowing,</p>
			<p class="i0">At point to thrust, and never alive had they won thereout.</p>
			<p class="i0">But forth out of heaven Hêrê darted, and pealed her shout</p>
			<p class="i0">From the rock Herkynian: with fear were they shaken because of her cry</p>
			<p class="i0">As one man all, for terribly crashed the wide-arched sky.</p>
			<p class="i0">Backward they turned at the Goddess’s warning, and then were they ware</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the track, whereby for their home-return they needs must fare.</p>
			<p class="i0">So at last came they to a beach where the sea-surge moaning rolled,</p>
			<p class="i0">By Hêrê’s devising, through tribes of the Keltic folk untold</p>
			<p class="i0">And Ligurians passing unharmed; for about them a mist-veil dread</p>
			<p class="i0">Day after day, as homeward they fared, did the Goddess spread.</p>
			<p class="i0">And so through the midmost mouth of the river Argo sailed,</p>
			<p class="i0">And safe on the ‘Long Row Isles’ did they land; for the prayers had prevailed</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the sons of Zeus; for the which cause altars and temples aye</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto these have been reared: nor with those sea-farers alone went they</p>
			<p class="i0">As helpers, but Zeus made these all mariners’ saviours to be.</p>
			<p class="i0">So the ‘Long Row’ left they, and on to Aithalia sped oversea.</p>
			<p class="i0">There in athlete-strife did they supple their limbs, till the sweat of them dripped</p>
			<p class="i0">As rain, and the pebbles are flecked as with scarf-skin strigil-stripped</p>
			<p class="i0">To this day; and their quoits and their wondrous armour are there, all stone;</p>
			<p class="i0">And yet in the name of the haven the glory of Argo is shown.</p>
			<p class="i1">And swiftly speeding thence they fleeted the sea-swell o’er,</p>
			<p class="i0">To Ausonia’s strand Tyrrhenian lifting their eyes evermore.</p>
			<p class="i0">And they came to Aiaia’s haven renowned, and forth of the prow</p>
			<p class="i0">The hawsers adown to the strand they cast. And Circê now</p>
			<p class="i0">There did they find, in the spray of the surf as she bathed her head,</p>
			<p class="i0">For that dreams of the night had made the Spell-queen sorely adread.</p>
			<p class="i0">For with blood did it seem that her palace-chambers, and every wall,</p>
			<p class="i0">Were running, and flame was devouring her magic herbs, even all</p>
			<p class="i0">Wherewith she was wont to bewitch what strangers soever came.</p>
			<p class="i0">And herself with the blood of murder quenched that red-glowing flame,</p>
			<p class="i0">Scooping it up with her hands: so ceased she from deadly dismay.</p>
			<p class="i0">Wherefore, when dawning uprose, in the sea-surf’s flashing spray</p>
			<p class="i0">At her waking she washed her vesture and bathed her braided hair.</p>
			<p class="i0">And beasts⁠—not like unto ravening beasts of the wold these were,</p>
			<p class="i0">Nor in likeness fashioned as men, but as though from a medley-heap</p>
			<p class="i0">They had gotten their limbs⁠—in a throng followed after her, even as sheep</p>
			<p class="i0">From the folds in their multitudes following after the shepherd go.</p>
			<p class="i0">Such shapes from the slime primeval did earth first cause to grow,</p>
			<p class="i0">Herself the creator, compacted of limbs in confusion blent,</p>
			<p class="i0">Ere yet into hardness she grew ’neath a rainless firmament,</p>
			<p class="i0">Neither yet from the shafts of a scorching sun had she gotten her dews</p>
			<p class="i0">Of refreshing: but these as the ranks of an army did Time confuse,</p>
			<p class="i0">As he marshalled them forth into being:⁠—such monsters after her pressed.</p>
			<p class="i0">And exceeding amazement fell on the heroes; and each man guessed,</p>
			<p class="i0">As he gazed upon Circê’s form, and the eyes unsoftened with ruth,</p>
			<p class="i0">That this should be none save Aiêtes’ sister in very sooth.</p>
			<p class="i1">So when she had bidden her terrors of dreams of the night to flee,</p>
			<p class="i0">Back straightway she paced; and the heroes she bade in her subtlety</p>
			<p class="i0">To follow, with witching beck of her fingers charming them on.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet steadfastly tarried the throng at the hest of Aison’s son</p>
			<p class="i0">In their place: but he went, and beside him the Kolchian maiden he drew.</p>
			<p class="i0">So trod they the selfsame path till they entered in, those two,</p>
			<p class="i0">Into Circê’s hall. In amaze at their coming, the Sorcery-queen</p>
			<p class="i0">Bade them to sit them down upon thrones of burnished sheen.</p>
			<p class="i0">But soundless and wordless they sped to her hearthstone’s hallowed place,</p>
			<p class="i0">And there sat, after the wont of the suppliant in evil case;</p>
			<p class="i0">And Medea bowed her adown, and in both hands hid her face.</p>
			<p class="i0">But Jason set in the earth his mighty-hilted sword</p>
			<p class="i0">Wherewithal he had slain Aiêtes’ son; and his eyes guilt-lowered</p>
			<p class="i0">Rose never to meet her glance. And straightway Circê was ware</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the vengeance-hounded feet, and the hands that the bloodstain bare.</p>
			<p class="i0">Therefore for awe of the statutes of Zeus the Suppliant-ward,</p>
			<p class="i0">The Manslayer’s Champion, yea, an exceeding jealous lord,</p>
			<p class="i0">She offered the sacrifice whereby they are cleansed from their guilt,</p>
			<p class="i0">When they come to his mercy-seat, by whose fierce hands blood hath been spilt.</p>
			<p class="i0">First, to atone for the murder inexpiate yet, she held</p>
			<p class="i0">Forth over their heads the young of a swine whose dugs yet swelled</p>
			<p class="i0">From the fruit of the womb; thereafter she severed its throat, and she dyed</p>
			<p class="i0">Their hands with the blood, and again with other drink-offerings beside</p>
			<p class="i0">Made the atonement, calling on Zeus, the Cleanser of all,</p>
			<p class="i0">The Avenger of suppliants murder-stained, on his name which call.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then all that in cleansing she used from the mansion her handmaids bore,</p>
			<p class="i0">The Naiad-nymphs, which ministered whatso she needed therefor.</p>
			<p class="i0">But Circê abode by the hearth, and thereon without wine did she burn,</p>
			<p class="i0">Praying the while, the atonement-cakes, to the end she might turn</p>
			<p class="i0">From their anger the terrible Vengeance-fiends, and that Zeus might be wrought</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto mercy and grace to the suppliants twain, his pardon who sought,</p>
			<p class="i0">Whether they bowed at his throne for the life of a stranger shed,</p>
			<p class="i0">Or their kindred hands with the blood of their nearest and dearest were red.</p>
			<p class="i1">But when she had wrought all so, and the work of atonement was done,</p>
			<p class="i0">Then raised she them up, and seated them each on a gleaming throne,</p>
			<p class="i0">And herself sat nigh them, and eye to eye she straitly inquired</p>
			<p class="i0">Wherefore they voyaged thus, and the thing that their hearts desired,</p>
			<p class="i0">And from what far shore they had come to her land and her palace-home,</p>
			<p class="i0">And in suppliance sat on her threshold; for into her soul had there come,</p>
			<p class="i0">As she pondered, a hideous thought, as her dreams in remembrance returned,</p>
			<p class="i0">And to hear the voice of the maiden her kinswoman sorely she yearned;</p>
			<p class="i0">For she knew her, so soon as she lifted her down-drooped eyes from the earth,</p>
			<p class="i0">For that plain to discern were all which drew from the Sun their birth,</p>
			<p class="i0">Forasmuch as they lightened afar a splendour like as of gold</p>
			<p class="i0">From the flashings of their eyes upon whoso their face should behold.</p>
			<p class="i0">So Medea told unto her all things that she craved to know,</p>
			<p class="i0">Speaking the Kolchian tongue with utterance gentle and low⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Deep-hearted Aiêtes’ child⁠—of the Quest, of the paths where fared</p>
			<p class="i0">The heroes, of all the conflicts sharp and stern that they dared;</p>
			<p class="i0">How herself into sin by her woeful sister’s pleading was led,</p>
			<p class="i0">And how from her father’s tyrannous terrors afar she had fled</p>
			<p class="i0">With Phrixus’ sons. But from this she shrank, that nothing she said</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Absyrtus’ murder; yet Circê discerned it: but pity-stirred</p>
			<p class="i0">By her woe-stricken kinswoman’s tears, she answered and spake the word:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Ah wretch! thou hast found thee an evil and shameful homeward path!</p>
			<p class="i0">Not long, I ween, shalt thou ’scape from Aiêtes’ terrible wrath.</p>
			<p class="i0">Nay, but full soon will he go to the dwellings of Hellas-land</p>
			<p class="i0">To avenge the blood of his son, the unspeakable deed of thine hand.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet, forasmuch as my suppliant thou art, and my sister withal,</p>
			<p class="i0">None other harm unto thee at thy coming of me shall befall.</p>
			<p class="i0">But begone from mine halls, companion who art in an alien’s flight⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Whosoe’er be this fellow unknown thou hast ta’en in thy father’s despite!⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Nay, knee me no knees, earth-croucher! Naught shalt thou win save blame,</p>
			<p class="i0">Save a curse for thine heart’s devices, for this thy flight of shame!’</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake she; and comfortless grief overwhelmed Medea: she cast</p>
			<p class="i0">Her robe o’er her eyes, and she wailed and wailed, till the hero at last</p>
			<p class="i0">By the hand upraised her, and forth of the palace-doors he led,</p>
			<p class="i0">As she quivered with terror: and so from the mansions of Circê they fled.</p>
			<p class="i1">Yet they passed not unmarked of the Bride of Zeus; but Iris bore</p>
			<p class="i0" id="fix_b4_l754a">Tidings to her, when she spied them faring forlorn from her door.</p>
			<p class="i0">For Hêrê had bidden her watch what time they should wend to the ship.</p>
			<p class="i0">So again on her message she sped her, and spake with eager lip:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Dear Iris, if ever mine hest thou fulfilledst in days overpast,</p>
			<p class="i0">Now hie thee away, upon hurrying pinions speeding fast.</p>
			<p class="i0">Hitherward bid thou Thetis to come to me, up from the sea</p>
			<p class="i0">Rising: for need of her cometh to me. Thence hasten thee</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto the echoing beaches whereon the brazen rows</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the Fire-god’s anvils are smitten with thunderous-crashing blows.</p>
			<p class="i0">Speak to him to still the fire-blast’s breathings, till Argo thereby</p>
			<p class="i0">Shall have sped: thereafter shalt thou with my message to Aiolus fly⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Aiolus, king of the welkin-begotten winds of the sky:⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Thou tell him my purpose, that all blasts under the firmament</p>
			<p class="i0">He may hush to rest, and let not a wandering gust be sent</p>
			<p class="i0">To ruffle the face of the sea: let Zephyr alone blow on,</p>
			<p class="i0">Until to Alkinoüs’ isle Phaeacian the heroes have won.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake she: forthright from the verge of Olympus did Iris leap</p>
			<p class="i0">Cleaving the welkin, outspreading her light wings. Into the deep</p>
			<p class="i0">Aegean she plunged, even there where the mansions of Nereus stand.</p>
			<p class="i0">And first unto Thetis she came, and according to all the command</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Hêrê she spake, and uproused her to Heaven’s Queen to soar.</p>
			<p class="i0">Next unto Hephaistus she came, and with speed at her word he forbore</p>
			<p class="i0">From the clanging of hammers of iron; and stayed from their tempest-blast</p>
			<p class="i0">Were the smoke-grimed bellows. Thereafter on to the third hath she passed,</p>
			<p class="i0">Aiolus, Hippotas’ glorious son. And even the while</p>
			<p class="i0">Her message she told, and her swift knees rested from journeying toil,</p>
			<p class="i0">Thetis from Nereus had gone and her sisters, and up from the sea</p>
			<p class="i0">And Olympus-ward to the presence of Hêrê the Queen passed she.</p>
			<p class="i0">And she caused her to sit by her side, and she uttered forth the word:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Hear, Goddess Thetis, the thing that my spirit to tell thee is stirred.</p>
			<p class="i0">Thou knowest how honoured is Aison’s son of me in mine heart,</p>
			<p class="i0">And they that with him in the toil of the Quest have borne their part.</p>
			<p class="i0">Alone did I save them then through the Clashing Rocks when they flew,</p>
			<p class="i0">When lightened the terrible flames, when the storm of the fire-blast blew,</p>
			<p class="i0">When white were the ragged reefs with the spume of the boiling surge.</p>
			<p class="i0">But a path by Scylla the Rock and Charybdis’ fathomless gorge</p>
			<p class="i0">Dreadly outbelching, awaits them:⁠—O Thetis, I nursed thee of yore,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even I, when thou wast but a wordless babe, and I loved thee more</p>
			<p class="i0">Than the others thy fellows, the Maids in the halls of brine which abide,</p>
			<p class="i0">Because thou refusedst, for all his desire, to couch by the side</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Zeus⁠—ay, so evermore be his thoughts all lust for embrace</p>
			<p class="i0">Of a Goddess immortal, or couch of a princess of mortal race!</p>
			<p class="i0">But for reverence of me, and for sacred fear which the heart of thee bare,</p>
			<p class="i0">Didst thou shrink from his love: thereafter a mighty oath he sware</p>
			<p class="i0">That never shouldst thou be called the bride of a God undying;</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet for all this spared not, but followed thee sore loth, lustfully eyeing,</p>
			<p class="i0">Till reverend Themis revealed unto him all Fate’s decree,</p>
			<p class="i0">How that thy weird was to bear a son who should mightier be</p>
			<p class="i0">Than his father: wherefore, for all his desire, he refrained, for dread</p>
			<p class="i0">Lest another should rise up matching his might, and should rule in his stead</p>
			<p class="i0">O’er the Deathless, and so should himself not hold the dominion for aye.</p>
			<p class="i0">But the best of the sons of earth for thine husband I found, in the day</p>
			<p class="i0">That saw thine espousals, that sweetness of marriage might comfort thee,</p>
			<p class="i0">And babes: and the Gods to the feast of thy solemnity,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even all, did I bid: in mine own hands then did the splendour shine</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the bridal torch, to requite that love, that honour of thine.</p>
			<p class="i0">Go to now, a word will I tell thee, a prophecy faithful and fast:</p>
			<p class="i0">What time thy son to the plain Elysian shall come at the last⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Thy son, who now in the dwellings of Cheiron the Centaur-king,</p>
			<p class="i0">Forlorn of the mother’s breast, is nursed by the Maids of the Spring⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">There is it his weird to wed Aiêtes’ daughter; but thou,</p>
			<p class="i0">Medea’s mother that shalt be, help thy daughter now,</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, Peleus withal⁠—ha! why is thine anger quenchless-hot?</p>
			<p class="i0">Folly was his; yet even the Gods may be folly-distraught.</p>
			<p class="i0">Of a surety, I ween, by my behests shall Hephaistus cease</p>
			<p class="i0">To cause the might of his fire to burn; and Hippotades,</p>
			<p class="i0">Aiolus, all the rushing wings of his winds shall refrain,</p>
			<p class="i0">Save only the steadfast-breathing West, till the heroes shall gain</p>
			<p class="i0">The havens Phaeacian. Devise for them thou a return without bane.</p>
			<p class="i0">For the crags and the tyrannous-buffeting surges make me afraid,</p>
			<p class="i0">These only; and these shall be foiled, if thou and thy sisters aid.</p>
			<p class="i0">In ’wildered amazement suffer them not to thrust their keel</p>
			<p class="i0">Charybdis-ward, lest down through her jaws to destruction they reel.</p>
			<p class="i0">Neither suffer thou them to approach unto Scylla’s hideous lair⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Ausonian Scylla the deadly, whom nightmare Hekatê bare,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even she whom Krataiïs they call, to the Ancient of the sea⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Lest with her horrible jaws down-swooping suddenly</p>
			<p class="i0">She destroy of the heroes the chiefest. But guide thou onward the ship</p>
			<p class="i0">In the course where still is a hairbreadth escape from destruction’s grip.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake she, and Thetis to her made answer with suchlike word:</p>
			<p class="i0">‘If the might of the ravening fire and the winds’ breath fury-stirred</p>
			<p class="i0">Shall in very deed be refrained, would I of a surety essay⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, I would pledge me, what though the surges should bar their way,</p>
			<p class="i0">To bring their ship safe through, if the West blow fresh and strong.</p>
			<p class="i0">But now is it time that I fare on the far track measureless-long</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto my sisters⁠—they which herein shall strengthen mine hand⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">And to where the ship’s stern-hawsers be cast forth on to the strand,</p>
			<p class="i0">That the men may at dawn take thought for the home-return to their land.’</p>
			<p class="i1">She spake, and departed, and plunged from the height of the heaven mid swirls</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the dark-blue sea; and she called to her sisters, the Nereïd-girls,</p>
			<p class="i0">To come to her help: and the Maids of the Sea, so soon as they heard,</p>
			<p class="i0">Gathered; and Thetis told them according to Hêrê’s word;</p>
			<p class="i0">And she sped them all to the sea Ausonian thence forthright.</p>
			<p class="i0">And swifter herself than the flash of an eye, or the arrows of light</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the sun, from the uttermost bourne when his chariot-wheels upflame,</p>
			<p class="i0">On through the water she fleeted and flashed, until she came</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto the beach Aiaian of that Tyrrhenian main.</p>
			<p class="i0">And she found by the galley the heroes: the shaft on the string did they strain</p>
			<p class="i0">For their sport, and the javelin they hurled: but she stole unto Peleus’ side,</p>
			<p class="i0">And she touched his hand; for of old had he won her, his Goddess-bride.</p>
			<p class="i0">But the eyes of the others were holden: to him did the Goddess appear,</p>
			<p class="i0">Of his eyes only discerned; and she murmured low in his ear:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘No longer now on the beaches Tyrrhenian sitting abide;</p>
			<p class="i0">But cast ye the hawsers of Argo loose with the dawning-tide,</p>
			<p class="i0">Obeying your helper Hêrê’s command; for at her behest</p>
			<p class="i0">The Sea-maids, daughters of Nereus, all to the trysting have pressed,</p>
			<p class="i0">Through the midst of the Rocks which the Wanderers hight your galley to speed</p>
			<p class="i0">Safe; for thereby is your course, and the path by fate decreed.</p>
			<p class="i0">But see that thou show me to none, when thine eyes my form discern</p>
			<p class="i0">Mid the Nymphs, as we meet thee, lest hotter thou cause mine anger to burn</p>
			<p class="i0">Than when erst thou didst kindle my spirit to anger swift and stern.’</p>
			<p class="i1">She spake, and she plunged through abysses of sea, and he saw her no more:</p>
			<p class="i0">And sharp pain smote him, who had not beheld her theretofore</p>
			<p class="i0">Since the day she forsook her bridal bower and her couch at the first,</p>
			<p class="i0">When for noble Achilles their babe into sudden anger she burst.</p>
			<p class="i0">For the mortal flesh of her child did the Goddess encompass aye</p>
			<p class="i0">Through the midst of the night with flames of fire, and day by day</p>
			<p class="i0">With ambrosia anointed his tender frame, to make him thereby</p>
			<p class="i0">Immortal, that loathly eld might come not his body anigh.</p>
			<p class="i0">But Peleus from slumber upstarted, and saw his beloved son</p>
			<p class="i0">Gasping mid flame; and he sent abroad, as he looked thereon,</p>
			<p class="i0">A terrible cry in his folly exceeding. She heard him, and whirled</p>
			<p class="i0">The babe aloft, and screaming adown on the earth she hurled:</p>
			<p class="i0">And herself like a breath of the wind, or a dream at the breaking of sleep,</p>
			<p class="i0">Forth of the hall flitted swiftly, and into the sea did she leap</p>
			<p class="i0">In her anger: and never thereafter returned she thither again.</p>
			<p class="i1">Amazement fettered his soul: but, for all his ’wildered pain,</p>
			<p class="i0">To his comrades he spake forth all the commands of his Goddess-wife.</p>
			<p class="i0">So these in the midst brake off, and refrained from the athlete-strife;</p>
			<p class="i0">And the meat of the eventide and the earth-strawn beds they dight,</p>
			<p class="i0">Whereon, having supped, as aforetime they laid them and slept through the night.</p>
			<p class="i1">When Dawn ’gan sprinkle the sky from her chalice of light overbrimming,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even then, when the wings of the West-wind the face of the waters were skimming,</p>
			<p class="i0">They went up from the strand, and they sat on the thwarts, and aboard they drew</p>
			<p class="i0">Blithely the anchor-stones from the deep, and in order due</p>
			<p class="i0">The rest of the tackling all they lashed, and the sail spread wide</p>
			<p class="i0">On high from the yard-arm, straining it taut with the sheets of hide.</p>
			<p class="i1">Onward the fresh breeze wafted the ship: full soon they beheld</p>
			<p class="i0">A fair isle flower-bestarred, where the Siren Destroyers dwelled,</p>
			<p class="i0">Acheloüs’ clear-voiced daughters, whose sweet songs wont to beguile</p>
			<p class="i0">With their witchery whosoe’er cast anchor anigh that isle.</p>
			<p class="i0">They were children whom lovely Terpsichorê, one of the Muses, bore</p>
			<p class="i0">To the flood Acheloüs: and unto Dêmêter’s daughter of yore,</p>
			<p class="i0">When she yet was unwedded, the noble Persephonê, ministered they,</p>
			<p class="i0">As in blended chorus they sang: but as birds in the latter day</p>
			<p class="i0">Were they fashioned in part to behold, and as maidens in part they were.</p>
			<p class="i0">And aye keeping watch from the harbour-cliffs overbeetling their lair,</p>
			<p class="i0">From many an one had they reft sweet home-return, whom they slew</p>
			<p class="i0">With wasting consuming them. Lo, on a sudden to Argo’s crew</p>
			<p class="i0">Pealed from their lips their clear-sweet voice. From the galley now</p>
			<p class="i0">Were they even at point to cast the hawser ashore from the prow;</p>
			<p class="i0">But Thracian Orpheus matched him against that demon choir,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the hands of Oiagrius’ scion swept the Bistonian lyre;</p>
			<p class="i0">And the march of the song o’er the rippling melody rang ever higher,</p>
			<p class="i0">Till their ears were filled with the chiming and thrilled with the triumph of sound,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the Sea-maids’ shrilling chant in the storm of the lyre was drowned.</p>
			<p class="i0">On flitted the ship, by the West-wind borne and the sighing swell</p>
			<p class="i0">Upleaping astern; and bootless the weird song failed and fell:⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Not bootless all, for that Teleon’s goodly son did leap</p>
			<p class="i0">From the polished thwart, ere his comrades could stay him, into the deep,</p>
			<p class="i0">Butes, whose soul was bewitched by the Sirens’ clear-ringing breath;</p>
			<p class="i0">And he swam through the purple surge to tread that strand of death.</p>
			<p class="i0">Doomed wretch!⁠—full soon had they robbed him there of his home-return;</p>
			<p class="i0">But for him did the Cyprian Lady of Eryx in pity yearn,</p>
			<p class="i0">And she snatched him away from the swirling wave, and safe she bore</p>
			<p class="i0">Of her grace to dwell on the height Lilybœan on Sicily’s shore.</p>
			<p class="i0">So in anguish of spirit they left him: but perils worse than these</p>
			<p class="i0">Awaited them⁠—shipwrecking gulfs in the meeting-place of the seas.</p>
			<p class="i0">For on this side Scylla’s smooth sheer crag uptowering loomed,</p>
			<p class="i0">And on that side Charybdis seething in ceaseless thunder boomed;</p>
			<p class="i0">And otherwhere, swung by the mighty surge, met clanging and crashing</p>
			<p class="i0">The Wandering Rocks, where afront were the spurts of fire out-flashing</p>
			<p class="i0">From the crests of the cliffs, o’er the crag red-glowing on high that burned.</p>
			<p class="i0">And with smoke was the air all mistily shrouded: thou hadst not discerned</p>
			<p class="i0">The beams of the sun. Then, albeit Hephaistus refrained from his toil,</p>
			<p class="i0">With the hot uprushing steam did the sea yet bubble and boil.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then Nereus’ daughters from this side and that side the heroes met,</p>
			<p class="i0">And Thetis the Goddess her hand to the blade of the rudder set;</p>
			<p class="i0">And onward amidst of the Wandering Rocks the ship haled they.</p>
			<p class="i0">And as when o’er the face of a summer sea the dolphins play</p>
			<p class="i0">Circling around a ship as she runneth before the wind,</p>
			<p class="i0">One while in front of her stern beheld, one while behind,</p>
			<p class="i0">And alongside anon: and the shipmen be blithe for their gambolling;</p>
			<p class="i0">So darted they up from the depths, so circled, a glimmering ring,</p>
			<p class="i0">Round Argo the ship; and Thetis was steering her course through all.</p>
			<p class="i0">And when now was the galley at point on the Wandering Rocks to fall,</p>
			<p class="i0">Straightway they kilted their skirts above their snowy knees,</p>
			<p class="i0">And high on the crests of the skerries, the breaking of madding seas,</p>
			<p class="i0">To this side and that side they sped, far ranged apart to stand.</p>
			<p class="i0">Sea-cataracts crashed on her beam, fierce surges on either hand</p>
			<p class="i0">Higher upsoaring and higher o’er the rocks were bursting and streaming;</p>
			<p class="i0">And these now towered to the welkin, as mountain-crags in seeming,</p>
			<p class="i0">And now, whelmed down the abyss, on the Ocean’s nethermost floor</p>
			<p class="i0">Grounded they: over their crests did the triumphing rollers roar.</p>
			<p class="i0">But the Nereïds, as maidens that flit to and fro on a sandy beach,</p>
			<p class="i0">With parted gown-laps kilted about the waist of each,</p>
			<p class="i0">Sport with a shapely rounded ball: one tosseth it on,</p>
			<p class="i0">And her fellow receiveth; and high ’twixt heaven and earth is it gone</p>
			<p class="i0">Sped from her hand to the welkin; and never it toucheth the ground,</p>
			<p class="i0">So from one unto other’s hand passed on did the galley bound</p>
			<p class="i0">Through the air o’er the crests of the waves as they sped her, clear alway</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the rocks; and around her the water upbelching was seething aye.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the Fire-king’s self on the ridge of a surf-lashed scaur was there,</p>
			<p class="i0">While his sturdy hammer the weight of his massy shoulder bare.</p>
			<p class="i0">Thence marvelling gazed Hephaistus: the bride of Zeus looked down</p>
			<p class="i0">Where she stood in the sunlit heaven, and round Athênê had thrown</p>
			<p class="i0">Her arms, in such faintness of fear, as she looked thereon, did she cling.</p>
			<p class="i0">And long as the space of a day is lengthened out in the spring,</p>
			<p class="i0">So long was the time that they laboured, heaving with might and main</p>
			<p class="i0">The ship through the thunderous-echoing rocks, till the wind again</p>
			<p class="i0">Blew out the canvas; and onward they ran, and swiftly they sped</p>
			<p class="i0">By the meads of Thrinakria’s isle, where the kine of the Sun-god fed.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then the Nymphs in the semblance of sea-mews down through abysses of brine</p>
			<p class="i0">Plunged, when wrought was the hest of Zeus’s Bride divine.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then through the air did there come to the heroes a bleating of sheep,</p>
			<p class="i0">And a lowing of kine full nigh to their ears floated over the deep.</p>
			<p class="i0">There a shepherdess-goddess pastured the sheep o’er the dewy lea,</p>
			<p class="i0">Phaëthusa⁠—youngest of all the Sun-god’s daughters was she⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Bearing a shepherd’s crook of silver the while in her hand;</p>
			<p class="i0">And Lampetiê herded the kine, and of mountain-brass was the wand</p>
			<p class="i0">That she swayed as she followed their steps: and the heroes themselves espied</p>
			<p class="i0">Those herds by the river that pastured, the sliding gleam beside,</p>
			<p class="i0">O’er the plain and the water-meadow: was none amid all that herd</p>
			<p class="i0">Dun-hued of hide, but all white even as milk appeared.</p>
			<p class="i0">And a glory of golden horns on the stately heads of them shone.</p>
			<p class="i0">So they passed in the daytime the Sun-god’s herds, and as night drew on,</p>
			<p class="i0">They went cleaving the great sea-gulf rejoicing, until once more</p>
			<p class="i0">The Child of the Mist, the Dawning, flashed on their sea-path hoar.</p>
			<p class="i1">Now fronting the mouth of the gulf Ionian lieth an isle</p>
			<p class="i0">In the sea Keraunian, forest-mantled, with deep rich soil,</p>
			<p class="i0">Whereunder the sickle, saith legend, is lying⁠—vouchsafe me your grace,</p>
			<p class="i0">Song-goddesses: loth do I speak of the tale of the olden days⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Wherewithal the strength of his father by Kronos was ruthlessly shorn:</p>
			<p class="i0">(But of some is it called Demêter-of-Hades’ Reaper of Corn:</p>
			<p class="i0">For Demêter in that land wont to abide in the days of old,</p>
			<p class="i0">And she taught the Titans to reap the cornfield’s spears of gold,</p>
			<p class="i0">Of her love unto Makris): the Sickle-land is it named therefrom,</p>
			<p class="i0">The Phaeacians’ hallowed nurse: and by lineage so these come</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Ouranus’ very blood, and his sons the Phaeacians be.</p>
			<p class="i0">So Argo through much tribulation came from Thrinakria’s sea</p>
			<p class="i0">With the breeze to the land Phaeacian. With welcoming sacrifice</p>
			<p class="i0">Alkinoüs the king and his people received them in kindly wise:</p>
			<p class="i0">And all the city with riot of mirth o’er the far-driven ones</p>
			<p class="i0">Rejoiced: thou hadst said that they joyed o’er their own re-given sons.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the heroes themselves through the throng in gladness triumphant strode,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even as though the heart of Haimonia-land they trod.</p>
			<p class="i1">But now were they like to be donning their mail for the onset-cry,</p>
			<p class="i0">So mighty a host of Kolchian men appeared hard by,</p>
			<p class="i0">Which down through the gorge of the Pontus, and on through the Crags Dark-blue</p>
			<p class="i0">Had passed to the uttermost sea in quest of the hero-crew.</p>
			<p class="i0">And Medea they chiefly were eager to hale to her father’s house</p>
			<p class="i0">Without parley, or threatened else that the war-yell dolorous</p>
			<p class="i0">Should be raised for the slaughter-vengeance unrelenting and stern</p>
			<p class="i0">Both then, and when led by Aiêtes their host should thereafter return.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet Alkinoüs the king restrained them amidst of their lust for the fray;</p>
			<p class="i0">For he greatly desired without the clash of the strife to allay</p>
			<p class="i0">The haughty-hearted feud betwixt the war-hosts twain.</p>
			<p class="i0">But the maiden in deadly fear besought again and again</p>
			<p class="i0">The comrades of Aison’s son; and again and again did she cling</p>
			<p class="i0">With her hands round the knees of Arêtê, the wife of Alkinoüs the king:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘I kneel unto thee, O Queen!⁠—be gracious, and yield me not now</p>
			<p class="i0">To the Kolchians to hale to my father, if thou art of humankind, thou</p>
			<p class="i0">Which livest by bread⁠—of the hearts into folly that swiftliest rush,</p>
			<p class="i0">Whom lightest transgression adown the abysses of ruin doth push,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even so as my wisdom forsook me⁠—nay, but it was not done</p>
			<p class="i0">By reason of lust: be witness the sacred light of the sun:</p>
			<p class="i0">Be witness the rites of Perseus’ daughter, which haunteth the night,</p>
			<p class="i0">That not of my will with men of an alien land in flight</p>
			<p class="i0">Did I haste from mine home; but horrible dread on my spirit wrought</p>
			<p class="i0">To bethink me of fleeing thus when I sinned: other help there was not,</p>
			<p class="i0">Neither hope. My maidenhead yet unmarred abideth and clean,</p>
			<p class="i0">As it was in the halls of my father. Have pity upon me, O Queen;</p>
			<p class="i0">And incline unto mercy the heart of thy lord! May the Deathless so</p>
			<p class="i0">A life all-perfect on thee, all happiness bestow,</p>
			<p class="i0">And sons, and the boast of a city unravaged of any foe!’</p>
			<p class="i1">So bowed at Arêtê’s knees did she weep, and so beseech;</p>
			<p class="i0">And thus to the heroes appealed she, turning to each after each:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘For your sakes, O ye chiefest of might, and for your emprise,</p>
			<p class="i0">Am I hounded of terrors thus, even I, by whose device</p>
			<p class="i0">Ye bowed the bulls to the yoke, and reaped that deadly swath</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the Earth-born Men⁠—even I, through whom on the homeward path</p>
			<p class="i0">Ye shall bear the Fleece of Gold full soon to Haimonia’s shore⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Even I, who have lost my country, my parents have lost evermore,</p>
			<p class="i0">Have lost mine home, have lost all pleasures of life that I knew,</p>
			<p class="i0">But to you have restored your country, your homes have restored unto you;</p>
			<p class="i0">And with rapture-litten eyes your parents again shall ye see.</p>
			<p class="i0">But from me⁠—a tyrannous god all happiness reft from me;</p>
			<p class="i0">And with alien men do I wander forlorn, an accursèd wight!</p>
			<p class="i0">Dread ye the covenant-troth and the oaths: the Avenging Sprite</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the suppliants dread, and the Gods’ retribution, if ever I come</p>
			<p class="i0">To Aiêtes’ hands, amid outrage and agony meeting my doom!</p>
			<p class="i0">No temple have I, neither tower of salvation, nor refuge beside:</p>
			<p class="i0">You cast I before me, mine only shield in the perilous tide.</p>
			<p class="i0">Hard hearts unrelenting and ruthless!⁠—ye know not reverence, ye,</p>
			<p class="i0">For the suppliant, though ye behold as I stretch despairingly</p>
			<p class="i0">Mine hands to the knees of a stranger queen. Yet the Kolchian array,</p>
			<p class="i0">One and all, had ye faced, when ye thirsted to bear the Fleece away:</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, Aiêtes the proud had ye faced:⁠—but your manhood hath fainted, is flown</p>
			<p class="i0">Now, when your foes from their helpers be sundered, a handful alone.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So passioned and prayed Medea. To whomso she bowed in prayer,</p>
			<p class="i0">Ever he heartened her, fain to assuage her anguished despair.</p>
			<p class="i0">And their keen-whetted lances in wrathful-quivering hands did they shake,</p>
			<p class="i0">And unscabbarded swords; and they swore they would fail not her help nor forsake,</p>
			<p class="i0">If the strange king touching the maiden unrighteous judgment spake.</p>
			<p class="i0">And lo, mid the throng as they wrangled, the night, that putteth to sleep</p>
			<p class="i0">The labours of men, stole o’er them, and all the earth did she steep</p>
			<p class="i0">In the balm of her quiet: but not on the maid fell slumber’s peace</p>
			<p class="i0">One whit, but her heart in her bosom for anguish writhed without cease.</p>
			<p class="i0">Even as when a toiling woman windeth her thread</p>
			<p class="i0">Through the night, and her fatherless children around her be moaning for bread,</p>
			<p class="i0">For that widowed she is; and adown her cheeks stream ever the tears</p>
			<p class="i0">As she thinketh upon this dreary lot that hath darkened her years;</p>
			<p class="i0">Even so were the maid’s cheeks wet, and her heart evermore in her breast</p>
			<p class="i0">On the anguish-thorn impaled was writhing in wild unrest.</p>
			<p class="i1">But amidst of the city the palace within, as in days gone by,</p>
			<p class="i0">Alkinoüs the king, and the lady of queenliest majesty,</p>
			<p class="i0">The wife of Alkinoüs, lay in their bed, and many a word</p>
			<p class="i0">Through the darkness in counsel they spake of the maiden; and thus to her lord</p>
			<p class="i0">With loving and earnest speech made answer the queen, and she said:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Yea, O my beloved⁠—yet save, I beseech thee, the woe-stricken maid</p>
			<p class="i0">From the Kolchians, showing a grace to the Minyan men. For anigh</p>
			<p class="i0">To our isle lieth Argos; the men of Haimonia dwell hard by.</p>
			<p class="i0">But Aiêtes⁠—he dwelleth not even anear, and nought do we know</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Aiêtes: we hear but his name. But the maiden’s awful woe,</p>
			<p class="i0">When she made supplication, mine heart within my breast hath torn.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yield her not up to the Kolchians, my king, to her sire to be borne.</p>
			<p class="i0">In madness she sinned at the first, when she gave him the charm that should tame</p>
			<p class="i0">The bulls; and with wrong to amend that wrong⁠—ay, ofttimes the same</p>
			<p class="i0">In our sinning we do!⁠—she straightway essayed; and, shrinking in fear</p>
			<p class="i0">From her proud sire’s tyrannous wrath, she fled. Now the man, as I hear,</p>
			<p class="i0">This Jason, is bound by mighty oaths, which his own lips said,</p>
			<p class="i0">When he pledged him to make her, his halls within, his wife true-wed.</p>
			<p class="i0">Wherefore, beloved, constrain not Aison’s son to forswear</p>
			<p class="i0">His oath, of thy will, nor consent that the sire from the daughter should tear</p>
			<p class="i0">Her life in the rage of his soul amid pangs unendurably keen:</p>
			<p class="i0">For cruelly jealous against their daughters are fathers, I ween.</p>
			<p class="i0">What vengeance did Nykteus wreak on Antiopê lovely-faced!</p>
			<p class="i0">What woes were of Danaê borne on the wide sea’s desolate waste</p>
			<p class="i0">Through her sire’s mad rage! And of late, nor afar, it came to pass</p>
			<p class="i0">That wanton-tyrannous Echetus thrust the goads of brass</p>
			<p class="i0">Through the eyes of his daughter: and wasted and worn by her woeful doom,</p>
			<p class="i0">She is grinding the grain of brass in a hovel’s dungeon-gloom.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake she beseeching; and softened so was the heart of the king</p>
			<p class="i0">By the words of his wife, and he spake in such wise answering:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Arêtê, the Kolchian men would I even, in harness arrayed,</p>
			<p class="i0">Drive forth of the land, for a grace to the heroes, to save yon maid.</p>
			<p class="i0">But I fear to set the unswerving justice of Zeus at nought.</p>
			<p class="i0">Nor were this well done, to contemn, according to this thy thought,</p>
			<p class="i0">Aiêtes:⁠—of kinglier king than Aiêtes may no man tell.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, war, if he list, shall he bring against Hellas, afar though he dwell.</p>
			<p class="i0">Wherefore ’tis meet and right that the sentence be spoken of me</p>
			<p class="i0">That in all men’s eyes shall be best, and I will not hide it from thee:⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">If the damsel be virgin yet, I decree that the daughter be led</p>
			<p class="i0">To the father: but if she minister unto a husband’s bed,</p>
			<p class="i0">I will part not from husband wife; nor, if haply she bear ’neath her zone</p>
			<p class="i0">His offspring, to foes will I yield up a child of Aison’s son.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake he, and round him straight did the veil of slumber close.</p>
			<p class="i0">But she laid up his wisdom her heart within; and she straightway uprose</p>
			<p class="i0">From her couch in the palace: the women her handmaids with hurrying feet</p>
			<p class="i0">Came, eagerly tending their lady the Queen with service meet.</p>
			<p class="i0">And she silently summoned her herald, and spake in his ears her request</p>
			<p class="i0">To be instant in bidding Aison’s son, at his Queen’s behest,</p>
			<p class="i0">To wed with the maiden, nor more with Alkinoüs the king to plead;</p>
			<p class="i0">For himself to the Kolchians would go and pronounce the doom decreed,</p>
			<p class="i0">That, if she were virgin yet, he would render her up to be led</p>
			<p class="i0">To her father: but if she ministered unto a husband’s bed,</p>
			<p class="i0">Not then would he sever the wife from the love of the lawfully wed.</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake she, and forth of the hall the feet of the herald sped</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto Jason, Arêtê the Queen’s fair-omened message to bring,</p>
			<p class="i0">And Alkinoüs’ counsel, the word of the god-revering king.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the heroes he found by the ship in their war-gear abiding awake</p>
			<p class="i0">In the haven of Hyllus, anigh to the city; and out he spake</p>
			<p class="i0">The Queen’s whole message, and each man’s spirit was gladness-stirred,</p>
			<p class="i0">Forasmuch as he spake in their ears an exceeding welcome word.</p>
			<p class="i1">Straightway they mingled the bowl to the Gods that abide for aye;</p>
			<p class="i0">And with reverent hands to the altar the victim-sheep drew they.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the selfsame night for the maiden prepared they the couch of the bride</p>
			<p class="i0">In a hallowed cave, where of old time Makris wont to abide,</p>
			<p class="i0">The child of the Honey-lord, Aristaius, whose wisdom discerned</p>
			<p class="i0">The toils of the bees, and the wealth of the labour of olives learned.</p>
			<p class="i0">And she was the first that received and in sheltering bosom bore</p>
			<p class="i0">The child Nysaian of Zeus, on Eubœa’s Abantian shore.</p>
			<p class="i0">And with honey she moistened his lips, where the dew of life was dried</p>
			<p class="i0">When Hermes bare him out of the fire. But Hêrê espied,</p>
			<p class="i0">And from all the isle that Nymph in her fierceness of anger she drave.</p>
			<p class="i0">Wherefore she dwelt far thence in the holy Phaeacian cave,</p>
			<p class="i0">And blessing and weal beyond word to the folk of the land she gave.</p>
			<p class="i0">Even there did they spread them the mighty couch and thereover they laid</p>
			<p class="i0">The glittering Golden Fleece, that the marriage so might be made</p>
			<p class="i0">Honoured, a song in the mouths of bards. Flowers manifold-fair</p>
			<p class="i0">The Nymphs in their snowy bosoms gathered, and thitherward bare.</p>
			<p class="i0">And a splendour like as of fire glowed round those shapes divine,</p>
			<p class="i0">Such glory-gleams from the golden tufts did shimmer and shine.</p>
			<p class="i0">Sweet longing lit up their eyes: howbeit did awe withhold</p>
			<p class="i0">Each one, though she yearned to lay but her hand on the wonder of gold.</p>
			<p class="i0">And of that bright throng the river Aigaius’ daughters were some,</p>
			<p class="i0">And some on the crests of Melitê dwelt in their mountain-home;</p>
			<p class="i0">And forest-glen Nymphs of the plains were some: for Zeus’s bride,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even Hêrê, had sent them for honour to Jason’s marriage-tide.</p>
			<p class="i0">That cave is to this day named Medea’s Sacred Grot,</p>
			<p class="i0">Forasmuch as to wedlock’s solemnities there these twain they brought,</p>
			<p class="i0">When the odorous-sweet fine linen they spread. And the heroes without</p>
			<p class="i0">Guarded them war-spear in hand, lest haply for battle the rout</p>
			<p class="i0">Of their foes unawares should set on them, or ever the rites were sped.</p>
			<p class="i0">And with sprays of bounteous leaf did they wreathe each man his head;</p>
			<p class="i0">And in harmony all, while clear the harp of Orpheus rang,</p>
			<p class="i0">At the entering-in of the cave the bridal hymn they sang.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet not in Alkinoüs’ home the hero Aison’s son,</p>
			<p class="i0">But in halls of his father, the goal of marriage full fain had won,</p>
			<p class="i0">When home he returned to Iolkos, and so withal was the mind</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Medea, but hard compulsion constrained them now to be joined.</p>
			<p class="i0">But even as never the tribes of the woe-stricken children of earth</p>
			<p class="i0">May tread full-footed the path of delight, but still with our mirth</p>
			<p class="i0">Hand in hand goeth pacing affliction bitter as gall,</p>
			<p class="i0">So these, when melted with rapture of love were their souls, were thrall</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto dread, what things of Alkinoüs’ sentence should haply befall.</p>
			<p class="i1">So soon as the dawn with her beams ambrosial climbed heaven’s height,</p>
			<p class="i0">And scattered the gloomy night through the welkin, and laughed in her light</p>
			<p class="i0">The island-beaches, and all the paths through the plains that wound</p>
			<p class="i0">Dew-gleaming afar, and awoke in the streets a murmur of sound,</p>
			<p class="i0">And her folk were astir through the town, and astir was the Kolchian host</p>
			<p class="i0">In their camp far off on the bounds of the Makrian sea-ringed coast.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then straightway Alkinoüs hied him, by covenant-plight to hold,</p>
			<p class="i0">To utter his purpose as touching the maiden. His sceptre of gold,</p>
			<p class="i0">His staff of justice, he bare, wherewith to the multitude</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the city were meted the statutes with righteousness endued.</p>
			<p class="i0">And beside him, in ordered ranks arrayed in their harness of fight,</p>
			<p class="i0">Squadron by squadron were marching Phaeacia’s chiefest of might.</p>
			<p class="i0">And forth from the tower-girt city in throngs the women broke</p>
			<p class="i0">To gaze on the heroes; and men therewithal of the country-folk</p>
			<p class="i0">Met them, which heard the tidings; for Hêrê afar had sped</p>
			<p class="i0">A rumour that erred not: and one a lamb unblemished led,</p>
			<p class="i0">The choice of the sheep: with a heifer unlaboured one drew nigh;</p>
			<p class="i0">And others were ranging the earthen jars of wine hard by</p>
			<p class="i0">To mingle. The sacrifice-smoke was wafted far away.</p>
			<p class="i0">Came women with webs of costly labour, as women may,</p>
			<p class="i0">And with trinkets of gold, and with manifold ornaments therebeside,</p>
			<p class="i0">Such gifts as be wont to be brought to the newly-wedded bride.</p>
			<p class="i0">And they marvelled beholding the heroes’ stature and comeliness,</p>
			<p class="i0">As they towered o’er the throng, and Oiagrius’ scion amidst of the press,</p>
			<p class="i0">As in time to the harmony-ringing lyre and the chanted strain</p>
			<p class="i0">Ever he smote and anon with his glittering sandal the plain.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the Nymphs all blending their voices, when marriage-notes chimed on the string,</p>
			<p class="i0">Uplifted the lovely bridal chant, and anon would they sing</p>
			<p class="i0">Alone and unprompted the song, as the wreaths of their dances they twined.</p>
			<p class="i0">O Hêrê, of thee was it done; for thou puttedst it into the mind</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Arêtê to tell Alkinoüs’ prudent word of the night.</p>
			<p class="i0">But so soon as the king had pronounced the decree of unswerving right,</p>
			<p class="i0">And when now was the marriage accomplished proclaimed in all men’s ears,</p>
			<p class="i0">Then took he heed that it so should abide: no deadly fears</p>
			<p class="i0">Touched him, nor Aiêtes’ terrible wrath might his purpose shake;</p>
			<p class="i0">But he held by the word he had plighted, the oath that he would not break.</p>
			<p class="i0">And when now were the Kolchians ware that in vain they besought him to swerve,</p>
			<p class="i0">And when now he commanded them⁠—‘Either obey my decree and observe,</p>
			<p class="i0">Or forth of my havens and land afar shall your galleys sail’;⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Then in that hour for their own king’s threatenings ’gan they quail,</p>
			<p class="i0">And besought him amongst his folk to receive them. So there in the land</p>
			<p class="i0">Long time with the people Phaeacian dwelt the Kolchian band,</p>
			<p class="i0">Till the Bacchiad lords, which by lineage sprang from Ephyrê,</p>
			<p class="i0">As the years passed, settled amidst them, and they to the isle oversea</p>
			<p class="i0">Sailed: thence to the Thunder-hills of Abantian men must they go,</p>
			<p class="i0">And therefrom to the folk Nestaian, and on to Oricum so.</p>
			<p class="i0">But the river of time ere then down many a year must flow.</p>
			<p class="i0">But still to the altars the yearly sacrifice men bring</p>
			<p class="i0">For the Fates and the Nymphs in the fane of Apollo the Shepherd-king,</p>
			<p class="i0">Which altars Medea builded. And gifts, ere they passed o’er the wave,</p>
			<p class="i0">Full many Alkinoüs gave them, and many Arêtê gave.</p>
			<p class="i0">Thereafter withal on Medea Phaeacian handmaid-thralls</p>
			<p class="i0">Twelve did the Queen bestow, to follow her forth of her halls.</p>
			<p class="i0">On the seventh day sailed they away from Drepanê. Came with the morn</p>
			<p class="i0">A fresh breeze sent of Zeus: and so by the wind’s breath borne</p>
			<p class="i0">Onward and onward they ran. Howbeit not yet on the strand</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Achaia by doom of the God might they tread, that hero-band,</p>
			<p class="i0">Till yet they had toiled in the uttermost parts of Libya-land.</p>
			<p class="i1">And now by the bay that is named the Ambracian Gulf had they sped,</p>
			<p class="i0">And now had they left the Aetolian land with sail wide spread;</p>
			<p class="i0">And thereafter the isles in the narrow Echinad strait that lie;</p>
			<p class="i0">And Pelops’ land in the offing but now might they dimly descry:</p>
			<p class="i0">Even then were they snatched away by the North-wind’s baleful blast</p>
			<p class="i0">In mid course: on to the Libyan sea did it sweep them fast</p>
			<p class="i0">Nine nights together, and days as many, until they had run</p>
			<p class="i0">Into the Syrtis afar, wherefrom returning is none</p>
			<p class="i0">For ships, when a storm-driven galley within that gulf shall be found.</p>
			<p class="i0">For on every hand be shoals, and the tangled weed all round</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the deep, and the salt foam-scum over all doth mantle and cling.</p>
			<p class="i0">Into haziest distance stretcheth the land: no living thing</p>
			<p class="i0">There moveth that creepeth or flieth. On that drear coast by the sweep</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the flood-tide⁠—for ofttimes the outrushing ebb draweth back to the deep</p>
			<p class="i0">Far off from the land, and again with gurgling rush and roar</p>
			<p class="i0">Cometh bursting over his beaches⁠—afar on the innermost shore</p>
			<p class="i0">Were they suddenly thrust, that the keel’s full depth was covered no more.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then leapt they forth of the ship, and in trouble of soul did they gaze</p>
			<p class="i0">On the dimness, the long low backs of the land all formless haze</p>
			<p class="i0">Far stretching away unbroken. Nor stream nor spring they espied,</p>
			<p class="i0">Neither path, nor, how distant soe’er, a steading thereon they descried</p>
			<p class="i0">Of herdmen, but all the landskip in dead calm folded lay.</p>
			<p class="i0">And in sore vexation of spirit did hero to hero say:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘What manner of land is this? Whither now hath the tempest’s sway</p>
			<p class="i0">Hurled us? Would God we had dared, all reckless of deadly dismay,</p>
			<p class="i0">To rush right on through the path of the rocks of the grim sea-gate!</p>
			<p class="i0">Verily better it were, had we overleapt the fate</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Zeus, in daring a deed of heroic mood to have died!</p>
			<p class="i0">But now, what thing should we do, which be prisoned by winds to abide</p>
			<p class="i0">Here, though but a little span we continue?⁠—in such drear wise</p>
			<p class="i0">The plain of the limitless land stretcheth up to the lowering skies.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So cried they: thereafter in utter despair for their evil case</p>
			<p class="i0">Ankaius the helmsman spake with anguish-darkened face:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Yea verily, ghastliest doom hath undone us. Escape there is not</p>
			<p class="i0">From destruction: for us but remaineth to suffer the cruellest lot,</p>
			<p class="i0">Which have fallen on this desolation; yea, even though a breath there should be</p>
			<p class="i0">Of air from the land, forasmuch as nought save shoals do I see,</p>
			<p class="i0">Afar as I gaze o’er the waters around; and scantly the brine</p>
			<p class="i0">Overscaleth the hoary sands in foam-fretted line upon line.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, and our god-built ship had to shards been wretchedly torn</p>
			<p class="i0">Long since far off from the shore, but that out of the sea was it borne</p>
			<p class="i0">By the flood-tide’s self uplifted, and high on the land was it thrown.</p>
			<p class="i0">But the tide now raceth aback to the deep, and foam alone</p>
			<p class="i0">Whereon saileth no keel, rolleth on, and but thinly the earth hath it veiled.</p>
			<p class="i0">Wherefore, I trow, all hope of our sailing hath utterly failed⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">All hope of return! Let another man show sea-craft herein.</p>
			<p class="i0">Lo, there is the helm⁠—whosoever is fain our deliverance to win,</p>
			<p class="i0">Let him sit in my seat. But little doth Zeus desire, I wot,</p>
			<p class="i0">To crown with a day of return the toils we have suffered and wrought.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake he, weeping the while; and the others agreed thereto,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even all which had knowledge of ships; and all the hearts of them grew</p>
			<p class="i0">Chilly and numb, and over their cheeks was paleness shed.</p>
			<p class="i0">And even as, like unto lifeless spectres of folk long dead,</p>
			<p class="i0">Men creep through the streets of a town, and despairing the issue await</p>
			<p class="i0">Of famine or leaguer of war, or a tempest unspeakably great</p>
			<p class="i0">Which hath swept o’er the land, and hath flooded the labours of oxen untold;</p>
			<p class="i0">Or when great gouts of blood from the images sweating have rolled,</p>
			<p class="i0">Or when from the shrines of the temple ghostly bellowings wail,</p>
			<p class="i0">Or the sun o’er the day’s mid noontide draweth the night’s black veil</p>
			<p class="i0">Out of heaven, and the glittering stars come forth in splendour pale;</p>
			<p class="i0">So stricken, the chieftains then by the strand’s verge endless-wide</p>
			<p class="i0">Roamed loitering on. And at one stride came dark eventide.</p>
			<p class="i0">And piteously around each other their arms did they throw</p>
			<p class="i0">With weeping farewell, that each from his fellow apart might go</p>
			<p class="i0">To die, and might fling him adown on the sand to wait for the end.</p>
			<p class="i0">So this way and that way to choose their couch of the night did they wend;</p>
			<p class="i0">And each in the folds of his mantle enshrouded his head, and they lay</p>
			<p class="i0">Fasting and thirsting there through the livelong night and the day</p>
			<p class="i0">Awaiting a piteous death. And the handmaids huddled in fear</p>
			<p class="i0">Round Aiêtes’ daughter apart shrilled lamentation drear.</p>
			<p class="i0">And as when, of their mother forsaken, fledglings shrilly cheep,</p>
			<p class="i0">Which have fallen to earth from a cleft in a sheer scaur’s precipice-steep,</p>
			<p class="i0">Or as when ’twixt the low-browed banks of Pactolus’ fair-flowing stream</p>
			<p class="i0">The swans are upraising their song, and the meadow of dewy gleam</p>
			<p class="i0">Murmureth round, and murmur the river’s ripples fair;</p>
			<p class="i0">So the handmaidens bowing low in the dust their golden hair,</p>
			<p class="i0">All through the night were uplifting their pitiful wail of despair.</p>
			<p class="i0">And now out of life had they slidden, had vanished from human ken,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the name and the fame of them never more had been heard among men,</p>
			<p class="i0">Those noblest of heroes!⁠—their task unaccomplished had ended then:</p>
			<p class="i0">Howbeit the Heroine-nymphs had pity of them as they pined</p>
			<p class="i0">In helpless despair, the Warders of Libya, they that did find</p>
			<p class="i0">Athênê, what time from the head of her father, in battle-gear</p>
			<p class="i0">All flashing, she sprang, and the new-born bathed they in Trito’s mere.</p>
			<p class="i0">The noon of the day it was, and the sun upon Libya-land</p>
			<p class="i0">Burned with his fiercest beams: by Aison’s son did they stand,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the mantle-shroud from his head with soft light touch drew they.</p>
			<p class="i0">But the hero, downward drooping his eyes, thence turned them away,</p>
			<p class="i0">For awe of the shapes divine: but with gentle words of cheer</p>
			<p class="i0">With open face did they speak unto him in his ’wildered fear:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Ill-starred one, wherefore so grievously smitten art thou with despair?</p>
			<p class="i0">We know how ye fared for the Golden Fleece: of your toils we be ware,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even all the strength-overmastering labours on land that ye proved,</p>
			<p class="i0">And all ye endured on the face of the watery deep as ye roved.</p>
			<p class="i0">The Solitary Ones of the land, the Heroines, are we,</p>
			<p class="i0">Warders and daughters of Libya, which speak which our voices to thee.</p>
			<p class="i0">Up then: let thy spirit not thus to affliction of misery yield,</p>
			<p class="i0">And uprouse thy comrades, so soon as the steeds of the car swift-wheeled</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Poseidon, by Amphitritê loosed from the yoke, run free.</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto your mother the nursing-debt then render ye</p>
			<p class="i0">For all her travail, when long she bare you her womb within.</p>
			<p class="i0">So haply again unto hallowed Achaia-land shall ye win.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake they, and vanished, there as they stood, in the selfsame place</p>
			<p class="i0">Where murmured their voices close in his ear: and with startled gaze</p>
			<p class="i0">Staring around, on the earth sat Jason, and cried in amaze:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Be gracious, ye glorious Goddesses, lone in the desert which dwell!</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet what this word of our home-coming meaneth I wot not well.</p>
			<p class="i0">I will gather my comrades, and tell them, and learn what token is this</p>
			<p class="i0">Of escape:⁠—in the multitude of counsellors safety there is.’</p>
			<p class="i1">Then he leapt to his feet, and he shouted afar o’er the desolate shore,</p>
			<p class="i0">All dust-begrimed, as a lion that seeking his mate doth roar</p>
			<p class="i0">Up and down through the forest-gloom: deep glens through many a hill</p>
			<p class="i0">Far off at the sound of his voice’s thunder shuddering thrill,</p>
			<p class="i0">And tremble the oxen that roam the meads with exceeding fear,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the herders of kine: but never a whit dismaying to hear</p>
			<p class="i0">Was the hero’s cry to his friends when the voice of his shouting they heard.</p>
			<p class="i0">And they gathered with down-drooped eyes to his side, and they sat at his word</p>
			<p class="i0">Sore troubled anigh where lay the ship; and the women withal</p>
			<p class="i0">With the heroes mingled sat; and he spake, and he told them all:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Hearken, O friends, for in this mine affliction Goddesses three,</p>
			<p class="i0">In vesture of goatskins girded about, from neck unto knee</p>
			<p class="i0">Overdrooping their shoulders and waists, as maidens of earth to behold,</p>
			<p class="i0">Stood over mine head full nigh, and they drew my mantle’s fold</p>
			<p class="i0">Away from mine head with fingers light, and they bade me arise</p>
			<p class="i0">From my couch of despair, bade rouse you up in the selfsame wise.</p>
			<p class="i0">And they bade us to render our mother the nursing-debt again⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Seeing that long in her womb she bare us with travail-pain⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Whensoever the steeds of the swift-wheeled car of the Lord of the Sea</p>
			<p class="i0">Amphitritê should loose from the yoke. Howbeit it is not in me</p>
			<p class="i0">To divine what their prophecy meaneth. They named them, that stranger-band,</p>
			<p class="i0">Heroines, daughters of Libya, and Warders of the Land.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, whatsoever toils we endured in our journeying</p>
			<p class="i0">By land or by sea, said they, they were ware of everything.</p>
			<p class="i0">No longer thereafter I saw them in place, but there came between</p>
			<p class="i0">A mist or a cloud⁠—they appeared, and lo! they were no more seen.’</p>
			<p class="i1">He spake, and they marvelled all such tale to hear him tell.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then to the Minyan men a most strange wonder befell:</p>
			<p class="i0">For out of the sea to the land did a horse gigantic bound</p>
			<p class="i0">With golden mane far-streaming that tossed his shoulders around.</p>
			<p class="i0">And with one swift stamp he shook from his shoulders the briny spray,</p>
			<p class="i0">And onward he galloped with feet like the blast of the wind: straightway</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto the throng of his comrades did Peleus rejoicing say:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘The steed of the car of the Lord of the Sea!⁠—unyoked hath he been</p>
			<p class="i0">Even but now by the hands of his dear-loved wife, I ween.</p>
			<p class="i0">And our mother⁠—none other is this, I divine, than the good ship there,</p>
			<p class="i0">Argo; for verily us within her womb she bare</p>
			<p class="i0">With grievous anguish of travail groaning unceasingly.</p>
			<p class="i0">Her therefore with stalwart strength and with tireless shoulders we</p>
			<p class="i0">Will uplift, and afar o’er the wastes of the sandy land from the shore</p>
			<p class="i0">Will we bear her, where yonder steed hath with swift feet sped before.</p>
			<p class="i0">For he will not, he, sink into the earth, but his hoof-prints shall go</p>
			<p class="i0">Pointing the way for us inland afar from the sea, I trow.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So did he speak: of his keen-witted counsel were all they fain.</p>
			<p class="i0">Lo, this is the song of the Muses, and I but sing their strain,</p>
			<p class="i0">The Pierides’ servant; and this true tale in mine ears hath been told</p>
			<p class="i0">That ye, O mightiest far of the sons of the kings of old,</p>
			<p class="i0">By your manhood and might o’er the sands of Libya’s desert drear</p>
			<p class="i0">Bare high over earth your galley and all her voyaging-gear,</p>
			<p class="i0">On your shoulders laid, yea, bare her through long days two and ten,</p>
			<p class="i0">And nights as many. That cup of affliction and travail then,</p>
			<p class="i0">What tongue could tell it, which these in their toil filled up full-brim?</p>
			<p class="i0">Of a truth of the blood of the Deathless they were, such labour grim</p>
			<p class="i0">Did they take on them, onward driven and on by Necessity’s goad,</p>
			<p class="i0">Till afar mid the ripples of Trito’s mere how triumphantly strode,</p>
			<p class="i0">How gladly adown from their stalwart shoulders they set their load!</p>
			<p class="i1">Then rushing, like unto hounds in the wild hunt’s frenzy-burst,</p>
			<p class="i0">Sought they a spring, for that now was there added parching thirst</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto all their affliction and manifold anguish; nor toiled they in vain</p>
			<p class="i0">Wandering there; for lo, they came to the sacred plain</p>
			<p class="i0">Where but yesterday Ladon the Serpent of Libya in Atlas’ garden</p>
			<p class="i0">Kept watch o’er the Apples of Gold; and the Nymphs around their warden,</p>
			<p class="i0">The Hesperides, rested never, chanting their lovely song.</p>
			<p class="i0">But now by the arrows of Herakles stricken he lay along</p>
			<p class="i0">By the trunk of the apple-tree: only the tip of his tail had strength</p>
			<p class="i0">To quiver yet, but adown from his head, through all the length</p>
			<p class="i0">Of his dark chine, lifeless he lay. Where the arrows had left in his blood</p>
			<p class="i0">The bitter gall of the Hydra of Lerna, a swarming brood</p>
			<p class="i0">Of flies o’er the venom-festering wounds of him crawled and clung.</p>
			<p class="i0">And thereby the Hesperides over their golden heads had flung</p>
			<p class="i0">Their white arms, shrilling their wail. And the wanderers suddenly drew</p>
			<p class="i0">Anear, and to dust and to earth straightway, when the hero-crew</p>
			<p class="i0">Came hastily on, did they turn even there. But Orpheus was ware</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the portent divine, and he stood, and he spake to the Nymphs in prayer:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Divine Ones, lovely and kindly, O Queens, be gracious ye,</p>
			<p class="i0">Whether amongst the Heavenly Goddesses numbered ye be,</p>
			<p class="i0">Or the Earthly, or whether they name you the Lone Ones, Nymphs divine,</p>
			<p class="i0">Come, O ye Nymphs, come, daughters of Ocean’s sacred line!</p>
			<p class="i0">Appear ye in manifest form to our longing eyes, and show</p>
			<p class="i0">Some spring gushing forth from the rock, some sacred upwelling flow</p>
			<p class="i0">From the bosom of Earth, O shapes divine, that the thirst which doth burn</p>
			<p class="i0">Our tongues without cease may be quenched; and if ever again we return</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto Achaia-land in our weariful voyaging,</p>
			<p class="i0">Then, as to the chiefest in heaven, to you which have done this thing</p>
			<p class="i0">Gifts and libations and feasts with grateful love will we bring.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake he, praying with earnest voice; and they from anear</p>
			<p class="i0">Pitied their pain. And first did they cause green grass to appear</p>
			<p class="i0">From the earth, and above the grass rose saplings tall, and these</p>
			<p class="i0">Thereafter in fulness of bloom grew up into fair young trees:</p>
			<p class="i0">Tall-standing and straight, high up from the face of the earth they towered.</p>
			<p class="i0">In a poplar was Hesperê veiled, Erythêis an elm embowered,</p>
			<p class="i0">And Aiglê a sacred willow. And out of the stems of them, lo!</p>
			<p class="i0">Appeared they, and like as before they had been, so again did they show,</p>
			<p class="i0">A marvel exceeding great: and Aiglê silence brake,</p>
			<p class="i0">And with gentle words in their longing ears she answered and spake:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Of a surety for blessing to you and deliverance out of your toil,</p>
			<p class="i0">Hitherward came but now one ruthless and shameless, to spoil</p>
			<p class="i0">Our guardian serpent of life; and the Goddesses’ apples of gold</p>
			<p class="i0">He plucked, and he bare them away, and he left us sorrowful-souled.</p>
			<p class="i0">For there came yestreen a man most fell in wanton despite,</p>
			<p class="i0">Grim-shapen, whose eyes ’neath his scowling brows flashed terrible light,</p>
			<p class="i0">A pitiless man: in a monster lion’s fell untanned,</p>
			<p class="i0">Raw hide, was he clad, with a stubborn olive-wood staff in his hand,</p>
			<p class="i0">And a bow, with the arrows whereof he shot yon dragon dead.</p>
			<p class="i0">And he came, he also, as one that afoot overland hath sped,</p>
			<p class="i0">Thirst-parched: and questing for water with diligent haste he sought</p>
			<p class="i0">Through all this place⁠—but, I ween, he was like to behold it not!</p>
			<p class="i0">Howbeit a certain rock by the mere Tritonian stood:</p>
			<p class="i0">This, or of his own device, or a God wrought so on his mood,</p>
			<p class="i0">Did he smite with his foot, and forth did the water in full burst flow.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then down to the earth on his hands and his breast he bowed him low;</p>
			<p class="i0">And out of the rifted rock an unspeakable draught he swilled,</p>
			<p class="i0">Till his mighty maw, down-stooped like a beast of the field, he had filled.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake she; and they right glad thence hasted, until they came</p>
			<p class="i0">To the place where Aiglê had told of the spring; and they found the same.</p>
			<p class="i0">And as when earth-burrowing ants swarm round their narrow pit,</p>
			<p class="i0">All hurrying to and fro, or when clustering flies, that have lit</p>
			<p class="i0">Where lieth a drop of the honey sweet, a tiny gout,</p>
			<p class="i0">Insatiate-eager are thronging, so in a huddled rout</p>
			<p class="i0">The Minyans round that rock-spring crowded on every side.</p>
			<p class="i0">And with wet lips thus in his gladness hero to hero cried:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘O strange!⁠—how hath Herakles saved his companions forspent with stress</p>
			<p class="i0">Of thirst, though afar he were! Would God that he yet might bless</p>
			<p class="i0">The eyes of us finding him faring on through the wilderness!’</p>
			<p class="i1">Then shouted in answer they which were ready-dight for the deed.</p>
			<p class="i0">And they parted, and this way and that way questing the lost did they speed.</p>
			<p class="i0">For the tracks of the hero by winds of the night had been wholly effaced,</p>
			<p class="i0">As they drifted the sand. And away did Boreas’ two sons haste,</p>
			<p class="i0">Putting trust in their wings; and Euphêmus trusting his feet flying fast,</p>
			<p class="i0">And Lynkeus the piercing glance of his eyes afar to cast:</p>
			<p class="i0">And Kanthus, the fifth of the searchers, darted away with the rest,</p>
			<p class="i0">Whom the doom of the Gods and his manfulness drave to essay that quest,</p>
			<p class="i0">That of Herakles’ mouth for certain tidings he so might inquire</p>
			<p class="i0">Where he left Polyphemus, Eilatus’ son; for with earnest desire</p>
			<p class="i0">Was he fain to ask of the hero concerning his lost friend’s fate:⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">But he mid the Mysians had builded a city glorious and great;</p>
			<p class="i0">Then yearning for home came o’er him, and seeking Argo he passed</p>
			<p class="i0">Far over the mainland, until he came to the land at the last</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the sea-board Chalybans: there ’neath the mastering doom did he fall,</p>
			<p class="i0">And there up-piled is his grave-mound under a poplar tall</p>
			<p class="i0">Facing the sea. But Lynkeus deemed that he spied that day</p>
			<p class="i0">Over measureless spaces of land lone-faring and far away</p>
			<p class="i0">Herakles⁠—saw him as one that hath seen or hath thought he hath seen</p>
			<p class="i0">The moon, when the month is young, through mist-veils floating between.</p>
			<p class="i0">To his comrades returned he, and told them that quester thereafter should see</p>
			<p class="i0">The hero no more as he journeyed. In like wise came those three,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even Euphêmus the swift of foot, and the scions twain</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the Thracian Wind of the North, having toiled and striven in vain.</p>
			<p class="i1">But, Kanthus, in Libya thee did the fell Fates bring to thine end.</p>
			<p class="i0">Upon pasturing flocks didst thou light; and the shepherd, that wont to tend</p>
			<p class="i0">Those sheep, in defending them smote thee, when thou thereof wast fain</p>
			<p class="i0">To take for thy comrades’ need, and there of his hand was thou slain</p>
			<p class="i0">By the cast of a stone; for in sooth no weakling there kept ward,</p>
			<p class="i0">Kaphaurus, the grandson of Phœbus, Lykoreia’s Lord,</p>
			<p class="i0">And of fair Akakallis the princess, whom Minos drave from her home</p>
			<p class="i0">In Libya to dwell, when the fruit of a God was found in her womb,</p>
			<p class="i0">His daughter she; and a glorious son unto Phœbus she bare,</p>
			<p class="i0">Amphithemis namèd, and Garamas⁠—twofold the names of him were.</p>
			<p class="i0">And a Nymph, the Lady of Trito’s Lake, did Amphithemis wed;</p>
			<p class="i0">And Nasamon’s might and Kaphaurus the strong she bare to his bed,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even him which smote down Kanthus, defending his sheep as he fought.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet from the chieftains’ avenging hands escaped he not,</p>
			<p class="i0">When they learned what deed he had done; and the Minyans sought their dead,</p>
			<p class="i0">And they took up the corse, and they laid him to rest in the strait earth-bed,</p>
			<p class="i0">Mourning, and took thereafter the slayer’s sheep for a prey.</p>
			<p class="i0">There also Mopsus, Ampykus’ son, in the selfsame day</p>
			<p class="i0">Did a pitiless fate cut off. Stern doom might he nowise shun</p>
			<p class="i0">By his prophecy-lore, forasmuch as avoidance of death is there none.</p>
			<p class="i0">For a dread snake lay mid the sand from the mid-noon sun to hide,</p>
			<p class="i0">Too sluggish to strike of his will at such as would turn aside;</p>
			<p class="i0">Nor yet would he dart full face upon one that in fear shrank back.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet into whomso but once he should spit his venom black,</p>
			<p class="i0">Of all that on life-sustaining earth draw living breath,</p>
			<p class="i0">Not a cubit’s length should be left of his path to the mansion of Death,</p>
			<p class="i0">No, not though the Healer God⁠—if this I may say, nor sin⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Should medicine him, if only his teeth should have grazed but the skin.</p>
			<p class="i0">For when over Libya flying godlike Perseus came⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Who is also Eurymedon; so did his mother name his name⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">As unto the king the Gorgon’s head new-severed he bore,</p>
			<p class="i0">Whatsoever to earth dropped down of the dark-red gouts of gore,</p>
			<p class="i0">All quickened, and serpents thereof of the selfsame brood did there spring.</p>
			<p class="i0">Now Mopsus pressed on the ridge of the spine of the deadly thing,</p>
			<p class="i0">Setting his left foot-sole thereupon; and the beast in his pain</p>
			<p class="i0">Writhed round it: the flesh ’twixt ankle and calf in his fangs hath he ta’en,</p>
			<p class="i0">And he tare it, the while Medea and all her handmaids fled</p>
			<p class="i0">In affright. Howbeit the seer was handling, nothing adread,</p>
			<p class="i0">The bleeding wound; for the pain not grievously vexed his soul.</p>
			<p class="i0">Ah wretch!⁠—for already a numbness of deadly slumber stole</p>
			<p class="i0">Unstringing his sinews: a thick mist flooded his eyes all round.</p>
			<p class="i0">Straightway his burdened limbs all helplessly sank to the ground,</p>
			<p class="i0">And chill did he grow. And his comrades, and Aison’s son, amazed</p>
			<p class="i0">At the strokes fast-falling of doom, on the dead man thronging gazed.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet not for a little space, albeit but newly dead,</p>
			<p class="i0">Might he lie in the sun, for that fast through his flesh ’gan corruption to spread</p>
			<p class="i0">From the venom: the very hair from the skin like slime was cast.</p>
			<p class="i0">Therefore they straightway delved them a deep trench, labouring fast</p>
			<p class="i0">With mattocks of brass; and in mourning thereafter their hair did they rend,</p>
			<p class="i0">Both they and the maidens, bewailing the dead man’s pitiful end.</p>
			<p class="i0">Round the hero meetly entombed then thrice in their warrior-gear</p>
			<p class="i0">Marched they, and over his grave the earth-mound high did they rear.</p>
			<p class="i1">But when now they were gone aboard of the ship, and the South-wind blew</p>
			<p class="i0">Over the sea, they must needs make guess of the strait wherethrough</p>
			<p class="i0">They should win forth out of Tritônis’ mere; neither any device</p>
			<p class="i0">Long had they, but all day long were they drifting in aimless wise.</p>
			<p class="i0">And as writheth a serpent along his crooked path, when beat</p>
			<p class="i0">The rays of the sun on the land, and scorch him with fiercest heat,</p>
			<p class="i0">And with hissing to this side and that side he turneth his head, and his eyne,</p>
			<p class="i0">Like unto sparks that leap from the furnace, glitter and shine</p>
			<p class="i0">For his fury, until to his lair through a cleft of the rock he may creep;</p>
			<p class="i0">So Argo, seeking a mouth of the mere, a fairway deep,</p>
			<p class="i0">Long time tacked to and fro. Then Orpheus suddenly spake,</p>
			<p class="i0">That Apollo’s massy tripod forth of the ship they should take,</p>
			<p class="i0">And propitiate the Gods of the land therewith for their home-going’s sake.</p>
			<p class="i0">So went they, and set Apollo’s goodly gift on the shore.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then stood before them one, the form of a youth who bore,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even Triton the Wide-dominioned. From earth he uplifted a clod,</p>
			<p class="i0">And he held it forth for his Stranger’s Gift; and spake the God:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Receive it, my friends: no gift exceeding goodly to see</p>
			<p class="i0">Here have I now to give unto them which seek unto me.</p>
			<p class="i0">But and if ye inquire touching this sea’s paths⁠—as many a time</p>
			<p class="i0">Is the need of men whose journeyings pass through an alien clime⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">I will tell you, seeing Poseidon hath made me to understand</p>
			<p class="i0">This sea, for that he is my father, and I am the king of the land</p>
			<p class="i0">By the sea⁠—if perchance to your ears from afar Eurypylus’ name,</p>
			<p class="i0">Son of the Land of the Beasts of Ravin, from Libya came.’</p>
			<p class="i1">He spake, and Euphêmus outstretched his hands right joyfully</p>
			<p class="i0">That gift of the clod to receive, and answering thus spake he:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘If thou peradventure of Atthis and Minos’ sea dost know,</p>
			<p class="i0">O hero, to us who inquire the truth unfailing show.</p>
			<p class="i0">For not of our will have we hitherward come, but the tempests’ might</p>
			<p class="i0">Hath hurled us afar, on the borders of this your land to light:</p>
			<p class="i0">And our galley, shoulder-uplifted, a weary burden, I wis,</p>
			<p class="i0">Through the desert we bare to the waves of thy mere. But we know not this,</p>
			<p class="i0">Whereby we shall sail thereout to win unto Pelops’ land.’</p>
			<p class="i1">He spake, and afar that other pointed, outstretching his hand</p>
			<p class="i0">To the sea, and the mouth of the deep-channelled mere, and he spake the word:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Lo, yonder lieth the path to the sea, where the deeps unstirred</p>
			<p class="i0">Darkest are gleaming: on either hand roll breakers white</p>
			<p class="i0">Green-glimmering under their shivering crests, and on forthright</p>
			<p class="i0">Through the lane of the breakers a straight path lieth to win from the mere.</p>
			<p class="i0">And yon sea misty in distance beyond Crete stretcheth clear</p>
			<p class="i0">To the sacred land of Pelops. But rightward still steer ye,</p>
			<p class="i0">When forth of the mere ye have thrust, and ye ride on the swell of the sea.</p>
			<p class="i0">And so long speed ye onward your course, close-hugging the land,</p>
			<p class="i0">Till ye come to an inland-trending gulf; and then shall ye stand</p>
			<p class="i0">Boldly across to the ness where endeth the sweep of the shore</p>
			<p class="i0">Beyond. Therefrom shall your course be perplexity-troubled no more.</p>
			<p class="i0">Now pass on your way rejoicing: let no man grieve the while</p>
			<p class="i0">That your limbs must labour, while yet ye have strength of your youth for toil.’</p>
			<p class="i1">With kindly counsel he spake; and they hied them aboard once more,</p>
			<p class="i0">With intent to get them forth of the mere by toil of the oar.</p>
			<p class="i0">On sped they with eager purpose: and now did Triton take</p>
			<p class="i0">On his shoulder the mighty tripod; and now did he enter the lake,</p>
			<p class="i0">And they saw:⁠—but thereafter did no man mark how he vanished from sight</p>
			<p class="i0">With the tripod, anigh though he were. Then each man’s heart grew light,</p>
			<p class="i0">For that now for their helping had met them one of the Gods ever-blest.</p>
			<p class="i0">And they cried unto Aison’s son to take of their sheep the best,</p>
			<p class="i0">And to sacrifice to the God, and to chant the hymn of praise.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then straightway he chose it in haste, and the victim on high did he raise,</p>
			<p class="i0">And slew it there on the stern, and the sacrifice-prayer he cried:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Thou God, who hast manifested thyself on the mere’s lone side⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Whether Triton the great sea-marvel thou be, or whether thy name</p>
			<p class="i0">Be Phorkys or Nereus mid Sea-nymphs of Nereus’ loins which came⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Be gracious thou, and vouchsafe heart-gladdening home-return.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So praying he severed the throat of the victim, and down from the stern</p>
			<p class="i0">Mid the waves did he cast it. Out of the deep yet again did he rise:</p>
			<p class="i0">In his own true form as a God was he manifest unto their eyes.</p>
			<p class="i0">And as when one traineth a fleet-foot steed for the broad race-course,</p>
			<p class="i0">Grasping the flowing mane of the hest-obeying horse,</p>
			<p class="i0">Running lightly beside him, while high he is arching his neck in his pride,</p>
			<p class="i0">And followeth on, and the gleaming bit, as from side to side</p>
			<p class="i0">He rolleth it ’twixt his champing jaws, is clashing and ringing;</p>
			<p class="i0">Even so with his hand to the keel of hollow Argo clinging,</p>
			<p class="i0">Seaward he thrust her; and all his form, from the stately crown</p>
			<p class="i0">Of his head, over back and waist and navel, thus far down</p>
			<p class="i0">Was his wondrous shape even such as the Gods ever-blessèd are.</p>
			<p class="i0">But down from his loins the tail of a sea-beast lengthened far</p>
			<p class="i0">Forking to this side and that, and he lashed the face of the tide</p>
			<p class="i0">With his spines, which parted below into fins outcurving wide</p>
			<p class="i0">In fashion like to the horns of the moon when the month is new.</p>
			<p class="i0">Onward he drave her, till sped from the thrust of his hand she flew</p>
			<p class="i0">To the sea: then sank he mid fathomless depths, and the heroes all</p>
			<p class="i0">Shouted, whose eyes beheld that awesome marvel befall.</p>
			<p class="i0">There is the haven of Argo, and there are the signs of her stay:</p>
			<p class="i0">There stand to Poseidon and Triton altars unto this day;</p>
			<p class="i0">Forasmuch as for that day tarried they there. But with sail outspread</p>
			<p class="i0">At the dawning again before the West-wind’s breath they fled.</p>
			<p class="i0">And ever they kept the while that desert land to the right.</p>
			<p class="i0">On the morning thereafter the ness they beheld, and the long sea-bight</p>
			<p class="i0">Inland-trending beyond that seaward-jutting ness.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then straightway the West-wind failed them, but blew the breath no less</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the cloudless South; and their hearts rejoiced, in the sail as it sighed.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the sun went down, and uprose the star of the folding-tide,</p>
			<p class="i0">Which bringeth from labour rest unto ploughmen toil-fordone.</p>
			<p class="i0">Even then, when the wind died down as the darkling night drew on,</p>
			<p class="i0">Furled they the idle sail, and the mast exceeding tall</p>
			<p class="i0">They lowered, and now to the toil of the polished oar did they fall</p>
			<p class="i0">All through the night and the day, and, when failed the light of the day,</p>
			<p class="i0">Through the night thereafter, till rugged Karpathos far away</p>
			<p class="i0">Welcomed them: thence did they shape their course unto where rose high</p>
			<p class="i0">Crete above all the rest of the isles in the sea which lie.</p>
			<p class="i1">There Talos, the man of brass, from the stubborn scaur as he tore</p>
			<p class="i0">Rock-shards, withstood them from making the hawsers fast to the shore,</p>
			<p class="i0">When came to the roadstead of Dirkê’s haven the sea-worn ones.</p>
			<p class="i0">Now he was the last of the brazen stock of the Ash-tree’s sons:</p>
			<p class="i0">In the days of the Sons of the Gods none other on earth abode.</p>
			<p class="i0">Him on Europa to guard her island Kronion bestowed;</p>
			<p class="i0">And thrice round Crete each day with his brazen feet he strode.</p>
			<p class="i0">Now in all the rest of his body and limbs was he fashioned of brass</p>
			<p class="i0">Which might not be broken: howbeit a blood-red vein there was</p>
			<p class="i0">By his ankle beneath the sinew, and guarded therewithin</p>
			<p class="i0">Were the issues of life and of death by nought save a film of skin.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the men were with travail outworn, yet aloof from the land drew they</p>
			<p class="i0">Their ship with the backward sweep of the oars, in exceeding dismay.</p>
			<p class="i0">To the outsea now from Crete had they turned them in plight forlorn,</p>
			<p class="i0">Tormented with thirst, and by all their travail-pain outworn;</p>
			<p class="i0">But, even as they turned them, Medea spake to the hero-crew:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Hear me: alone, I ween, can I for your helping subdue</p>
			<p class="i0">Yon man, whosoever he be, though fashioned of brass all through</p>
			<p class="i0">Be his body, except he have life everlasting added thereto.</p>
			<p class="i0">But consent ye to keep hereby your galley beyond the flight</p>
			<p class="i0">Of his stones, till he yield unto me his overmastered might.’</p>
			<p class="i1">Then backed they the galley, beyond the cast of his arm, to rest</p>
			<p class="i0">On the oars; and they waited to see what counsel, of all unguessed,</p>
			<p class="i0">She would bring to pass. Then on either side of her cheeks did she hold</p>
			<p class="i0">For a veil before her face her purple mantle’s fold.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then up to the deck she went, and her hand did Aison’s son</p>
			<p class="i0">Grasp in his own, and from thwart to thwart so led her on.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the spell-chant raised she: the Fates with singing invoked she there,</p>
			<p class="i0">Devourers of souls, swift hounds of Hades, through all the air</p>
			<p class="i0">Which be hovering ever, and swoop on the doomed the living among.</p>
			<p class="i0">Bowing the knee unto these three times she invoked them with song,</p>
			<p class="i0">And thrice with prayer; and with soul unto mischief shapen she cast</p>
			<p class="i0">The glance of the evil eye upon Talos, his vision to blast.</p>
			<p class="i0">And her teeth gnashed fury accursèd upon him, the arms of her waved</p>
			<p class="i0">Beckonings of doom, as of one that in frenzy of hatred raved.</p>
			<p class="i1">Zeus Father, awe as a wind on my spirit bloweth chill,</p>
			<p class="i0">Seeing how by disease not alone, nor by wounds, the doom of ill</p>
			<p class="i0">Meeteth us, yea, how one from afar shall work our bane!</p>
			<p class="i0">Even as he, though brazen, yielded yet to be slain</p>
			<p class="i0">By the might of Medea the sorceress. Then, as he heaved on high</p>
			<p class="i0">The massy rocks to withstand them from coming the haven anigh,</p>
			<p class="i0">On a spur of the crag did he graze his heel, and the ichor-flood</p>
			<p class="i0">Like melting lead gushed forth: nor long thereafter he stood</p>
			<p class="i0">Towering up on the rock out-jutting that frowned o’er the brine.</p>
			<p class="i0">But, even as high on the mountain side a giant pine⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Which the woodmen have left, when adown from the forest at even they hie,</p>
			<p class="i0">With the keen axe half hewn through⁠—as the winds of the night pass by,</p>
			<p class="i0">Shivereth first in the blast, and swayeth; but, snapt ere long</p>
			<p class="i0">At the stump, down falleth; so he on his feet all tireless-strong</p>
			<p class="i0">For a little space yet stood, yet swayed he to and fro.</p>
			<p class="i0">Thereafter all strengthless fell with a mighty crash their foe.</p>
			<p class="i0">For that night there on the shore of Crete did the heroes lie;</p>
			<p class="i0">But thereafter, so soon as the glow of the dawn overflushed the sky,</p>
			<p class="i0">A fane to Athênê Minôïs builded they thereby.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then water they drew them, and hied them aboard, that with oars swift-sped</p>
			<p class="i0">Before all else they might pass beyond Salmônê’s Head.</p>
			<p class="i1">But even as they ran over Crete’s wide sea, all suddenly came</p>
			<p class="i0">A horror of darkness on them, which the Pall of Blackness they name,</p>
			<p class="i0">The Night of Destruction. No stars shone through it, no faint ray gleamed</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the moon: black chaos from heaven descended, or haply upstreamed</p>
			<p class="i0">Darkness that might be felt from the depths of the nethermost hell.</p>
			<p class="i0">And whether through Hades they drifted, or heaved on the waters’ swell,</p>
			<p class="i0">Nowise they knew; but unto the sea in helpless despair</p>
			<p class="i0">They committed their home-return, to bear as it would. But in prayer</p>
			<p class="i0">Cried Jason with mighty voice, and to Phœbus his hands did he raise,</p>
			<p class="i0">Calling on him to save them, the while the tears ran down his face</p>
			<p class="i0">In his trouble. To Pytho and Amyklae promised he once and again</p>
			<p class="i0">Offerings unnumbered to bear, and gifts to Ortygia’s fane.</p>
			<p class="i0">And thou, O Lêto’s son, wast swift to hear: from on high</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto Melas’ rocks thou descendedst, amidst of the sea which lie.</p>
			<p class="i0">Twin peaks hath the isle: upon one thereof didst thou dart, and stand</p>
			<p class="i0">Uplifting on high thy golden bow in a God’s right hand.</p>
			<p class="i0">Flashed round thee on every side the bow’s bright splendour-sheen.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then of the voyagers’ eyes was a little island seen</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the Sporades, overagainst Hippuris’ tiny isle.</p>
			<p class="i0">There cast they anchor, and waited: and soon Dawn’s rosy smile</p>
			<p class="i0">Flushed up through the sky. In a tree-shadowed dell to Apollo they made</p>
			<p class="i0">A goodly hallowed place, and an altar mid twilight of shade.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the Splendour-god, because of the splendour that far-seen flamed,</p>
			<p class="i0">Phœbus they called; and Anaphê, ‘Isle of Revealing,’ they named</p>
			<p class="i0">That rock, for that Phœbus revealed it to men bewildered sore.</p>
			<p class="i0">And they sacrificed whatso men might provide on a desolate shore</p>
			<p class="i0">For the sacrifice: but when, for that wine they had none, they shed</p>
			<p class="i0">Water over the brands on the altar glowing red,</p>
			<p class="i0">Medea’s Phaeacian maidens beholding them could not refrain</p>
			<p class="i0">The laughter their bosoms within any more; for that oxen slain</p>
			<p class="i0">For the sacrifice in Alcinoüs’ halls had they seen full oft.</p>
			<p class="i0">But the heroes with mirthful hearts cast back their railing, and scoffed</p>
			<p class="i0">With gibing words: and so, like the flame’s light-flickering play,</p>
			<p class="i0">Flashed taunts ’twixt these and contention of jesting. And unto this day,</p>
			<p class="i0">From the old song-sport of the heroes, in that isle women fling</p>
			<p class="i0">Even such light scoffs at the men when gifts of atonement they bring</p>
			<p class="i0">To Apollo the Splendour-god, unto Anaphê’s Warder-king.</p>
			<p class="i1">But when thence they had loosed the hawsers, when summer-winds blew light,</p>
			<p class="i0">Then did Euphêmus call to remembrance a dream of the night,</p>
			<p class="i0">In his awe of the glorious son of Maia. For lo, him thought</p>
			<p class="i0">That the god-given clod in his palm close unto his breast he had caught.</p>
			<p class="i0">And therefrom like a suckling babe white streams of milk it drew,</p>
			<p class="i0">Till the clod, for all that so little it were, to a woman grew</p>
			<p class="i0">Like to a virgin. In love’s embrace, by desire overborne,</p>
			<p class="i0">Did he lie with the damsel: yet even as a maiden for ruth did he mourn</p>
			<p class="i0">To have humbled her whom the very milk of his breast had fed.</p>
			<p class="i0">But she with unangry words spake comfort to him, and she said:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Offspring of Triton am I, and the nurse of thy children to be:</p>
			<p class="i0">No maid, dear friend; for that Triton and Libya gave birth unto me.</p>
			<p class="i0">But me to the maidens the Daughters of Nereus do thou restore</p>
			<p class="i0">To dwell in the sea nigh Anaphê’s isle. I shall rise once more</p>
			<p class="i0">To the light of the sun, for thy children’s children a home prepared.’</p>
			<p class="i1">Now his heart called this to remembrance; and all that dream he declared</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto Aison’s son: then he mused in his soul on a prophecy</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the Smiter from Far, and he uttered his thought, and thus spake he:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘O strange!⁠—of a surety a weird of glorious renown is thine!</p>
			<p class="i0">For the Gods shall make this clod, when thou castest it into the brine,</p>
			<p class="i0">An island, wherein thy children’s children hereafter shall live.</p>
			<p class="i0">For this was the stranger’s-gift which Triton did freely give</p>
			<p class="i0">To thine hand on the Libyan shore. Of the Gods that abide for aye</p>
			<p class="i0">None other was he who gave, when he met thee there in the way.’</p>
			<p class="i1">He spake, and Euphêmus set not at nought that answering word;</p>
			<p class="i0">But his heart for the Aisonid’s oracle-promise was gladness-stirred;</p>
			<p class="i0">And he cast ’mid the surges the clod. Thence rose up an isle from the sea,</p>
			<p class="i0">Kallistê, the sacred nurse of Euphêmus’ children to be,</p>
			<p class="i0">Which in Sintian Lemnos wont to dwell in the ancient days,</p>
			<p class="i0">And from Lemnos were driven forth by men of Tyrrhenian race;</p>
			<p class="i0">And to Sparta as suppliants came they: from Sparta fared they on,</p>
			<p class="i0">Until they were led of Thôras, Autesion’s mighty son,</p>
			<p class="i0">To Kallistê: then changed they its name, and Thôra the isle did they call</p>
			<p class="i0">From their chief:⁠—but after Euphêmus’ days did this befall.</p>
			<p class="i1">Thence parting, unhindered o’er long sea-rollers untold did they fare</p>
			<p class="i0">Till they stayed on Aigina’s beach; and in innocent rivalry there</p>
			<p class="i0">Hero with hero contended, the while the water they drew,</p>
			<p class="i0">Who first should draw it, and who to the ship win first of the crew.</p>
			<p class="i0">For their need, and withal the fresh strong breeze, bade hasten away.</p>
			<p class="i0">Wherefore it cometh that yet do the youths of the Myrmidons lay</p>
			<p class="i0">On their shoulders the jars full-brimmed, and burdened so do they speed</p>
			<p class="i0">With light-running feet o’er the race-course striving for victory’s meed.</p>
			<p class="i1">Be gracious, O blest generation of chieftains!⁠—may these lays ring</p>
			<p class="i0">Year after year in the ears of men ever sweeter to sing!</p>
			<p class="i0">For now at the last am I come to the glorious ending of all,</p>
			<p class="i0">To the bourne of your travail: for struggle nor strife did thereafter befall</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto you, as homeward-bound from Aigina did Argo flee,</p>
			<p class="i0">Neither tempest of winds brake forth; but over a peaceful sea</p>
			<p class="i0">By the land of Kekrops, by Aulis coasting, and under the lee</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Eubœa, by cities Opuntian of Lokrian men did ye fleet,</p>
			<p class="i0">Till with rapture of welcome on Pagasae’s strand ye set your feet.</p>
