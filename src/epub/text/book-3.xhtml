			<p class="i0"><span class="sc">Come</span>, Erato, now, stand by me: of thy lips let me be taught</p>
			<p class="i0">In what manner thereafter Jason the Fleece to Iolkos brought</p>
			<p class="i0">Through the love of Medea: for thou in the things by the Cyprian ordained</p>
			<p class="i0">Hast part, and maidens unwedded by thine enchantments are chained;</p>
			<p class="i0">Wherefore it is that a name that telleth of love thou hast gained.</p>
			<p class="i1">So there in the close-pleached covert of river-reeds unseen</p>
			<p class="i0">Did the heroes in ambush wait. Then marked them Hêrê the queen</p>
			<p class="i0">And Athênê withal; and aloof from Zeus’ self turned they aside,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the rest of the Gods everlasting, and into a chamber they hied</p>
			<p class="i0">For counsel: and first spake Hêrê, to try Athênê therein:</p>
			<p class="i1">“Thyself now first, O daughter of Zeus, our counsel begin.</p>
			<p class="i0">What needeth to do? Wilt thou frame some subtle device, that these</p>
			<p class="i0">May win from Aiêtes and bear unto Hellas the Golden Fleece?</p>
			<p class="i0">Or with words shall they overpersuade him, with soft speech melt him to ruth?</p>
			<p class="i0">Now nay, for a proud and haughty scorner he is in sooth:</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet it may not in any wise be that our emprise turn aside.”</p>
			<p class="i1">So did she speak; and straightway to her Athênê replied:</p>
			<p class="i0">“Yea, mine heart even as thine herein was pondering</p>
			<p class="i0">When with questions thou searchedst me, Hêrê. Howbeit, as touching the thing,</p>
			<p class="i0">Not yet in mine heart have I found this wile, which shall help the need</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the soul of the chieftains: and yet have I mused upon many a rede.”</p>
			<p class="i1">She spake; and their eyes on the threshold before their feet they cast,</p>
			<p class="i0">As they pondered of this and of that, till Hêrê cried at the last⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">For a thought in her heart had birth, and her word was first again:⁠—</p>
			<p class="i1">“Let us hence to the Cyprian Queen; and when we be come, we twain</p>
			<p class="i0">Will pray her to bid her son, if perchance he will do this deed,</p>
			<p class="i0">At Aiêtes’ sorceress-daughter a shaft from his bow to speed,</p>
			<p class="i0">And bewitch her with love for Jason: by her devising, I trow,</p>
			<p class="i0">Bearing the Fleece away unto Hellas the hero shall go.”</p>
			<p class="i1">She spake; and her counsel of wisdom pleased Athênê well;</p>
			<p class="i0">And she answered⁠—and now from her lips soft words of persuasion fell:⁠—</p>
			<p class="i1">“Hêrê, my father begat me unweeting of shafts of love:</p>
			<p class="i0">Nothing I know of desire, or the magic spells thereof.</p>
			<p class="i0">But if this word pleaseth thyself, of a truth will I go with thee.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet thou must speak our request when the Cyprian’s face we see.”</p>
			<p class="i1">Then soared they away, and unto the mighty palace they came</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Kypris: her lord the Halt-foot God had builded the same</p>
			<p class="i0">For his bride, when he led her forth from the halls of Zeus of yore.</p>
			<p class="i0">So they entered the courts, and under the chamber-corridor</p>
			<p class="i0">Stood, where the hands of the Goddess the couch of Hephaistus prepared.</p>
			<p class="i0">But he at the dawning thence to his forges and anvils had fared</p>
			<p class="i0">In the cavern wide of a sea-washed isle, where he aye wrought on</p>
			<p class="i0">With the fire-blasts fashioning manifold marvels: but she alone</p>
			<p class="i0">Facing the doors of the palace sat in a carven chair.</p>
			<p class="i0">Over her shoulders white had she loosened the waves of her hair,</p>
			<p class="i0">And a golden comb through their ripples she drew, and now would she braid</p>
			<p class="i0">The long plaits up; but before her beheld she the twain, and she stayed</p>
			<p class="i0">Her hand, and she rose from her throne, and she bade them within her hall,</p>
			<p class="i0">And on couches she caused them to sit; thereafter herself withal</p>
			<p class="i0">Sat down, and her uncombed tresses coiled she about her head;</p>
			<p class="i0">And smiling innocent-arch to the Goddesses twain she said:</p>
			<p class="i1">“Dear sisters, what purpose or need hath brought you hither at last</p>
			<p class="i0">Who have tarried so long afar? Why come ye? In days overpast</p>
			<p class="i0">Not oft hath your presence been here⁠—too great for such as I!”</p>
			<p class="i1">Then unto her did Hêrê with stately speech reply:</p>
			<p class="i0">“Thou mockest, the while our heart with calamity’s shadow is dark,</p>
			<p class="i0">For that even now in Phasis the river moored is the bark</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Aison’s son, and the rest on the Quest of the Fleece that have come.</p>
			<p class="i0">For all their sakes⁠—for that nigh is the deed and the hour of doom⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Exceeding sorely we fear, but most for Aison’s son.</p>
			<p class="i0">Him I⁠—yea, though unto Hades now he were voyaging on</p>
			<p class="i0">To break those fetters of brass wherewithal Ixion is bound⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Will deliver, so far as strength in these my limbs is found,</p>
			<p class="i0">Lest Pelias should laugh, having ’scaped the doom, his iniquity’s price,</p>
			<p class="i0">Who in pride of his heart hath left me unhonoured with sacrifice.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, and before that Jason was passing dear unto me,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even since, when Anaurus’ outfall in full flood poured to the sea,</p>
			<p class="i0">In the day when men’s heart-righteousness fain would I prove and know,</p>
			<p class="i0">Coming back from the hunting he met me; and all overmantled with snow</p>
			<p class="i0">Were the mountain-ridges and towering peaks, and adown from them poured</p>
			<p class="i0">The winter-tide floods, and the rolling torrents rattled and roared;</p>
			<p class="i0">And he pitied the grey old crone, and he took me up at my prayer,</p>
			<p class="i0">And over the seaward-madding flood on his shoulders he bare.</p>
			<p class="i0">Therefore I honour him now, and will honour: unharmed shall he be</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Pelias’ spite⁠—yea, though his return be unaided of thee.”</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake she: the lips of Kypris could frame no word for a space,</p>
			<p class="i0">In her awe to behold great Hêrê asking of her a grace.</p>
			<p class="i0">And with courteous-gentle speech then spake she answering:</p>
			<p class="i1">“O Goddess dread, may there never be found any viler thing</p>
			<p class="i0">Than Kypris, if I shall set at naught desire of thine</p>
			<p class="i0">Or in word or in deed, whatsoever these frail hands of mine</p>
			<p class="i0">May avail; and for all that I do nor thank nor requital would I.”</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake she; and Hêrê again in her wisdom made reply:</p>
			<p class="i0">“It is nowise for lack of might that we come, nor of strength of hand.</p>
			<p class="i0">But thou to thy child in peaceful quietness speak thy command</p>
			<p class="i0">To bewitch Aiêtes’ daughter with love for Aison’s seed;</p>
			<p class="i0">For if she with her counsel shall help him, with loving favour lead,</p>
			<p class="i0">Lightly, I ween, shall the hero win the Fleece of Gold,</p>
			<p class="i0">And return to Iolkos, seeing the maiden is subtle-souled.”</p>
			<p class="i1">So did she speak; and the Lady of Cyprus answered thereto:</p>
			<p class="i0">“Hêrê, Athênê, my child would render obedience to you</p>
			<p class="i0">More than to me: in your presence a little abashed shall he be,</p>
			<p class="i0">Bold boy though he be:⁠—but nothing at all he regardeth me.</p>
			<p class="i0">But ever he striveth against me, and laugheth mine hests to scorn.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, I am minded, by that his naughtiness overborne,</p>
			<p class="i0">His evil-sounding shafts and his bow therewithal to break</p>
			<p class="i0">Full in his sight: for of late this threat in his anger he spake,</p>
			<p class="i0">That, if I refrained not mine hands while his passion within him was strong,</p>
			<p class="i0">My scathe upon mine own head should be, upon me the wrong.”</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake she: the Goddesses smiled, and each in her fellow’s eyes</p>
			<p class="i0">Looked: but again she spake, and her speech was burdened with sighs:</p>
			<p class="i1">“Unto others my griefs be for laughter alone, and I ought not so</p>
			<p class="i0">To tell them to all:⁠—enough that mine heart must its bitterness know.</p>
			<p class="i0">Howbeit, if this be all your soul’s desire this day,</p>
			<p class="i0">I will try, and with soft words win him: he shall not say me nay.”</p>
			<p class="i1">She spake; and with touch caressing did Hêrê her slim hand take,</p>
			<p class="i0">And, softly smiling the while, she answered, and thus she spake:</p>
			<p class="i1">“Even so, Kythereia, with speed perform thou this our request</p>
			<p class="i0">As thou sayest; and vex not thyself, neither strive with angered breast</p>
			<p class="i0">With thy child: from his troubling of thee hereafter shalt thou have rest.”</p>
			<p class="i1">She spake, and she rose from her seat, and Athênê passed at her side,</p>
			<p class="i0">As forth they sped and away, they twain: but the Cyprian hied</p>
			<p class="i0">To Olympus, and down its ridges, seeking her child, she passed.</p>
			<p class="i0">And in Zeus’s fruitful orchard-close she found him at last,</p>
			<p class="i0">Not alone, Ganymedes was with him, the boy whom Zeus on a day</p>
			<p class="i0">From earth unto heaven had brought to abide with Immortals for aye,</p>
			<p class="i0">When he greatly desired his beauty. With golden dice these two</p>
			<p class="i0">Were playing, even as boys like-minded be wont to do.</p>
			<p class="i0">And already Eros the greedy the palm of his left hand pressed,</p>
			<p class="i0">Filled full with the golden spoils of his winning, against his breast,</p>
			<p class="i0">Standing upright; the while a sweet flush mantled and glowed</p>
			<p class="i0">O’er the bloom of his cheeks: but the other was crouching on bent knees bowed</p>
			<p class="i0">In downcast silence: he had but twain; on the earth he flung</p>
			<p class="i0">One after other, by Eros’s gibing laughter stung.</p>
			<p class="i0">But, even as fared the former, he lost them, the last of his dice;</p>
			<p class="i0">And with empty and helpless hands he went; and his down-drooped eyes</p>
			<p class="i0">Marked not the coming of Kypris. Before her child did she stand,</p>
			<p class="i0">And with loving chiding she spake, as she laid on his lips her hand:</p>
			<p class="i1">“Why smil’st thou in triumph, thou naughty varlet? Hast thou not beguiled</p>
			<p class="i0">Thy playmate?⁠—and fairly hast thou overcome that innocent child?</p>
			<p class="i0">Go to now, accomplish my bidding, the thing that I shall ask;</p>
			<p class="i0">And the plaything exceeding fair of Zeus shall requite thy task,</p>
			<p class="i0">Which was fashioned by Adresteia his nurse for her babe’s delight,</p>
			<p class="i0">When, a child, he thought as a child, in the cave ’neath Ida’s height.</p>
			<p class="i0">A ball fair-rounded it is: no goodlier toy, I wot,</p>
			<p class="i0">Couldst thou get thee mid all the marvels by hands of Hephaistus wrought.</p>
			<p class="i0">Of gold be the zones of it fashioned; and round each several one</p>
			<p class="i0">Twofold be the seams of broidery-thread that encircling run.</p>
			<p class="i0">But the stitches thereof be hidden: there coileth around them all</p>
			<p class="i0">A spiral of blue. From thine hand if thou cast it on high, that ball</p>
			<p class="i0">Even as a star shall flash through the air in a fiery glow.</p>
			<p class="i0">This will I give thee⁠—but thou must bewitch with a shaft from thy bow</p>
			<p class="i0">Aiêtes’ daughter with love for Jason. But see that herein</p>
			<p class="i0">Thou tarry not; else a meaner requital than this shalt thou win.”</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake she, and welcome the word was; with gladness he heard that thing:</p>
			<p class="i0">And he cast away those toys, and with eager hands did he cling</p>
			<p class="i0">Clasping the Goddess’s raiment about on either side.</p>
			<p class="i0">And he pleaded with her even then to bestow it: but Kypris replied</p>
			<p class="i0">With gentle words⁠—and his cheeks unto hers she drew the while,</p>
			<p class="i0">And clasping him close she kissed him, and answer she made with a smile:</p>
			<p class="i1">“Be witness now thy beloved head, yea, also mine,</p>
			<p class="i0">That I will not defraud thee: indeed and in truth the gift shall be thine,</p>
			<p class="i0">When the heart of Aiêtes’ daughter is pierced by thine arrow divine.”</p>
			<p class="i1">Then gathered he up his dice, and the tale of them heedfully told,</p>
			<p class="i0">And he cast them into his mother’s glistering bosom-fold.</p>
			<p class="i0">By his baldric of gold he slung from his shoulder the quiver that leant</p>
			<p class="i0">On a tree-trunk, and took the bow for sorrow of mortals bent.</p>
			<p class="i0">From the fruitful orchard of Zeus’s palace forth did he fare,</p>
			<p class="i0">And thereafter came to Olympus’ portals high in air.</p>
			<p class="i0">Thence is a sheer-descending path from the height of the sky;</p>
			<p class="i0">And there the Poles, twin mountains, uplift their heads on high,</p>
			<p class="i0">Precipice-steeps, earth’s loftiest-towering crests, whereon</p>
			<p class="i0">With his earliest rays at the dawning uplifted resteth the sun.</p>
			<p class="i0">Far under, the life-sustaining earth and the cities slept</p>
			<p class="i0">Of men, and the sacred rivers; anon before him upleapt</p>
			<p class="i0">Hill-peaks, and outspread the sea, through the wide air on as he swept.</p>
			<p class="i1">Now the heroes apart on the thwarts of their galley in ambush yet,</p>
			<p class="i0">Where the backwater gleamed of the river, for taking of counsel were met:</p>
			<p class="i0">And the son of Aison himself was speaking, and all they heard,</p>
			<p class="i0">As row upon row in their places they sat, and none spake word:</p>
			<p class="i1">“O friends, of a truth the thing that seemeth good in mine eyes,</p>
			<p class="i0">That will I utter; howbeit with you the fulfilment lies.</p>
			<p class="i0">This Quest all share, and in counsel and speech all ye have part.</p>
			<p class="i0">Whosoever in silence withholdeth his rede and the thoughts of his heart,</p>
			<p class="i0">Let him know, he only bereaveth of home-return our Quest.</p>
			<p class="i0">Now I counsel that ye by the ship with your war-gear abide at rest.</p>
			<p class="i0">But I, even I, will go forth first to Aiêtes’ hall.</p>
			<p class="i0">I will take but the sons of Phrixus, and twain of the rest therewithal.</p>
			<p class="i0">And I, when I meet him, with words will first make trial, to know</p>
			<p class="i0">If he haply for lovingkindness the Fleece of Gold will bestow,</p>
			<p class="i0">Or will grant it not, but in pride of his might will set us at naught.</p>
			<p class="i0">For so, when the lesson of evil first by himself hath been taught,</p>
			<p class="i0">Shall we then advise us, whether the ordeal of battle to try,</p>
			<p class="i0">Or if other device shall avail us, refraining the onset-cry.</p>
			<p class="i0">But let us not rashly, or ever persuasion be put to the test,</p>
			<p class="i0">Despoil this man of his own possession:⁠—nay, it were best</p>
			<p class="i0">To come before him, and first with speech his grace to win:⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, oft fair speech hath prevailed in a matter, and lightly⁠—wherein</p>
			<p class="i0">Little had prowess availed⁠—for that winsomely it stole</p>
			<p class="i0">On the heart: yea hereby Phrixus wrought on the grim king’s soul,</p>
			<p class="i0">When a stepdame’s guile and the sacrifice-stroke of a father he fled,</p>
			<p class="i0">To receive him: in no man’s breast is shame so utterly dead,</p>
			<p class="i0">But he honoureth Guest-ward Zeus, and regardeth his ordinance dread.”</p>
			<p class="i1">Then praised they with one accord the counsel of Aison’s seed,</p>
			<p class="i0">Nor did any man turn therefrom, to utter another rede.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then called he on Phrixus’ children to follow, and chose of his band</p>
			<p class="i0">Telamon and Augeias; moreover himself took Hermes’ wand.</p>
			<p class="i0">Forthright from the ship over water and reed-fringed river-side</p>
			<p class="i0">Passed they, and out beyond o’er the swell of the plain they hied.</p>
			<p class="i0">The Plain Kirkaian, I wot, is it called, and, row upon row,</p>
			<p class="i0">Willows and osiers there exceeding many grow.</p>
			<p class="i0">Mid their topmost branches cord-bound corpses be hanging there;</p>
			<p class="i0">For to Kolchians unto this day an abomination it were</p>
			<p class="i0">To burn on the pyre their men which have died; nor yet in the ground</p>
			<p class="i0">Is their wont to lay them, and heap thereover the token-mound.</p>
			<p class="i0">But in hides untanned of oxen they roll them, and hang midst trees</p>
			<p class="i0">Without the city. Yet earth hath equal share in these</p>
			<p class="i0">With the air; for in graves of the earth be they wont their women to lay.</p>
			<p class="i0">Lo, this is their custom, and this their ordinance for aye.</p>
			<p class="i1">Now, anigh as they drew, did Hêrê with loving thought for the men</p>
			<p class="i0">Spread thick mist all through the city, that so they might ’scape the ken</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the thousands there, to Aiêtes’ hall while fared they on.</p>
			<p class="i0">And when from the plain to Aiêtes’ city and palace they won,</p>
			<p class="i0">Then straightway Hêrê scattered again that cloudy haze.</p>
			<p class="i0">At the entrance they stood, and they looked on the courts of the king in amaze,</p>
			<p class="i0">On the gateways wide, and the columns that all around the walls</p>
			<p class="i0">In ordered lines uprose; and high on the roofs of the halls</p>
			<p class="i0">Did a coping of stone upon rows of brazen triglyphs lie.</p>
			<p class="i0">And over the threshold in peace they went. And hard thereby</p>
			<p class="i0">Were garden-vines in fulness of blossom, mantled o’er</p>
			<p class="i0">With green leaves, high uplifted in air. And fountains four</p>
			<p class="i0">Ever-flowing beneath them ran, which were delved with magic spell</p>
			<p class="i0">By Hephaistus, the one whereof did with gushing of milk upwell,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the second with wine, and the third with incense-breathing oil.</p>
			<p class="i0">And with water the fourth ran; steaming for heat did the same upboil</p>
			<p class="i0">At the setting-tide of the Pleiads; but out of its rock-hewn cave</p>
			<p class="i0">Cold even as ice in their rising-season bubbled the wave.</p>
			<p class="i0">Even such were the marvellous works that Hephaistus the craftwise God</p>
			<p class="i0">Fashioned within Kytaian Aiêtes’ palace-abode.</p>
			<p class="i0">And he wrought for him brazen-footed bulls, and their mouths were of brass,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the terrible splendour of blazing flame the breath of them was.</p>
			<p class="i0">Moreover a plough of unbending adamant, all in one,</p>
			<p class="i0">Did he forge for him, making therein his requital of thanks to the Sun,</p>
			<p class="i0">Who had taken him up in his chariot, faint from the Phlegra fight.</p>
			<p class="i0">There also was builded the inner court, and around it were pight</p>
			<p class="i0">Many chambers on either hand with two-leaved doors fair-dight;</p>
			<p class="i0">And without them a rich-wrought corridor ran to left and to right;</p>
			<p class="i0">And athwart them the loftiest buildings rose upon either side,</p>
			<p class="i0">Whereof one over its fellows uplifted its crest of pride:</p>
			<p class="i0">Therein with his queen Aiêtes abode, the lord of the land;</p>
			<p class="i0">And thereby did the mansion fair of his son Absyrtus stand,</p>
			<p class="i0">Whom a Nymph Caucasian, Asterodeia, bare to his bed</p>
			<p class="i0">Or ever he led Eiduia home, his wife true-wed,</p>
			<p class="i0">Daughter of Tethys and Ocean, even their youngest one:</p>
			<p class="i0">But the sons of the Kolchians gave him a new name, Phaëthon,</p>
			<p class="i0">“The Shining,” for all the youths were in beauty by him outshone.</p>
			<p class="i0">In the rest did the handmaid-train and Aiêtes’ daughters abide,</p>
			<p class="i0">Chalkiopê and Medea. And now had Medea hied</p>
			<p class="i0">From her chamber forth to her sister’s; for Hêrê restrained her that day</p>
			<p class="i0">That she went not abroad: but little she wont theretofore to stay</p>
			<p class="i0">In the palace, but all day long in the temple of Hekatê</p>
			<p class="i0">Her conversation she had, for the Goddess’s priestess was she.</p>
			<p class="i0">And she saw them, and cried aloud; and suddenly heard was her call</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Chalkiopê: and her handmaids down at their feet let fall</p>
			<p class="i0">Their yarn and their threads, and forth of the chamber ran they all</p>
			<p class="i0">In a throng, and amidst them the mother: and there beholding her sons</p>
			<p class="i0">She cast up her hands in her gladness; and those re-given ones</p>
			<p class="i0">Greeted their mother, and lovingly gazed on her, folding her round</p>
			<p class="i0">With their arms, till her words mid sobbings broken utterance found:</p>
			<p class="i1">“So then ye were not to leave me in lonely childless pain,</p>
			<p class="i0">And to wander afar; and fate hath turned you backward again.</p>
			<p class="i0">O hapless I!⁠—what yearning for Hellas awoke in your breasts,</p>
			<p class="i0">By some strange woeful madness, at Phrixus your father’s behests?</p>
			<p class="i0">Bitter affliction did he ordain, when dying he lay,</p>
			<p class="i0">For mine heart!⁠—O why to Orchomenus’ city far away⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Whosoe’er this Orchomenus be⁠—for Athamas’ wealth should ye go,</p>
			<p class="i0">Leaving your mother alone to bear her burden of woe?”</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake she, and last came forth Aiêtes hastening,</p>
			<p class="i0">And came Eiduia herself, the wife of Aiêtes the king,</p>
			<p class="i0">When the outcry of Chalkiopê she heard. And the court straightway</p>
			<p class="i0">Was filled with a noisy throng; for some of the thralls ’gan flay</p>
			<p class="i0">A huge ox, some with the brass ’gan cleave the billets dry,</p>
			<p class="i0">And some with the fire ’gan heat the baths. There was none thereby</p>
			<p class="i0">That lagged in his task, as they toiled beneath that stern king’s eye.</p>
			<p class="i1">But Eros the while through the mist-grey air passed all unseen</p>
			<p class="i0">Troubling them, even as heifers that hear the piping keen</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the gadfly⁠—“the breese” do the herders of oxen name the thing.</p>
			<p class="i0">In the forecourt beneath the lintel swiftly his bow did he string:</p>
			<p class="i0">From his quiver took he a shaft sigh-laden, unshot before:</p>
			<p class="i0">With swift feet all unmarked hath he passed the threshold o’er,</p>
			<p class="i0">Keen-glancing around: he hath glided close by Aison’s son:</p>
			<p class="i0">He hath grasped the string in the midst, and the arrow-notch laid thereon.</p>
			<p class="i0">Straightway he strained it with both hands sundered wide apart,</p>
			<p class="i0">And he shot at Medea; and speechless amazement filled her heart.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the God himself from the high-roofed hall forth-flashing returned</p>
			<p class="i0">Laughing aloud. Deep down in the maiden’s bosom burned</p>
			<p class="i0">His arrow like unto flame; and at Aison’s son she cast</p>
			<p class="i0">Side-glances of love evermore; and panted hard and fast</p>
			<p class="i0">’Neath its burden the heart in her breast, nor did any remembrance remain</p>
			<p class="i0">Of aught beside, but her soul was melted with rapturous pain.</p>
			<p class="i0">And as some poor daughter of toil, who hath distaff ever in hand,</p>
			<p class="i0">Heapeth the slivers of wood about a blazing brand</p>
			<p class="i0">To lighten her darkness with splendour her rafters beneath, when her eyes</p>
			<p class="i0">Have prevented the dawn; and the flame, upleaping in wondrous wise</p>
			<p class="i0">From the one little torch, ever waxing consumeth all that heap;</p>
			<p class="i0">So, burning in secret, about her heart did he coil and creep,</p>
			<p class="i0">Love the destroyer: her soft cheeks’ colour went and came,</p>
			<p class="i0">Pale now, and anon, through her soul’s confusion, with crimson aflame.</p>
			<p class="i1">Now when ready-dight was the banquet by labour of handmaid and thrall,</p>
			<p class="i0">And by steaming baths’ refreshment their faces were lightened withal,</p>
			<p class="i0">Gladly they feasted and drank till their souls were satisfied.</p>
			<p class="i0">Thereafter unto the sons of his daughter Aiêtes cried:</p>
			<p class="i0">And this was the word of his mouth, as inquisition he made:</p>
			<p class="i1">“Ye sons of my daughter and Phrixus, the man unto whom I paid</p>
			<p class="i0">Honour above all men that have stood mine halls within,</p>
			<p class="i0">How came ye to Aia returning?⁠—did some dark curse of sin</p>
			<p class="i0">Break short in the midst your escape? Ye would not hear nor obey</p>
			<p class="i0">Me, when I set before you the endless length of the way.</p>
			<p class="i0">For I marked it, when once I was whirled in my father the Sun-god’s car,</p>
			<p class="i0">In the day wherein he wafted my sister Kirkê afar</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto Hesperia-land, till the chariot at last made stay</p>
			<p class="i0">On the Tyrrhene mainland-shore, where even unto this day</p>
			<p class="i0">She abideth, exceeding far from the land where the Kolchians dwell.</p>
			<p class="i0">What profit or pleasure in words? Speak out and plainly tell</p>
			<p class="i0">What happed in the midst of your journey, and say who these men be</p>
			<p class="i0">That have come with you hither. And where from your galley ashore came ye?”</p>
			<p class="i1">So did he question; and answered him Argus before the rest⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">But his heart misgave him concerning the son of Aison’s quest;⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">With soft words spake he, seeing that he was the elder-born:</p>
			<p class="i1">“Aiêtes, that our ship full quickly asunder was torn</p>
			<p class="i0">By stormy blasts, and we, unto beams of the wreck as we clung,</p>
			<p class="i0">On the beach of the War-god’s Isle by the sweep of the surges were flung</p>
			<p class="i0">In the murky night. Some God from destruction redeemed us, I trow;</p>
			<p class="i0">For even the birds of Ares, that wont to haunt ere now</p>
			<p class="i0">That desolate isle of the sea, even these we found no more;</p>
			<p class="i0">But these men drave them away when they landed the day before</p>
			<p class="i0">From their galley: and there by the purpose of Zeus, compassionate</p>
			<p class="i0">Of our plight, were they kept from departing, or bound peradventure by fate.</p>
			<p class="i0">Straightway to our need with food and with raiment they ministered,</p>
			<p class="i0">So soon as the name of Phrixus the far-renowned they heard,</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, and thine own: for unto thy town be they voyaging.</p>
			<p class="i0">And if thou wouldst know their need, I will hide not from thee the thing.</p>
			<p class="i0">A certain king being fain with exceeding vehement spite</p>
			<p class="i0">From his land and possessions to drive this man, forasmuch as in might</p>
			<p class="i0">Of his hands he was peerless amongst the heroes of Aiolus’ seed,</p>
			<p class="i0">Sendeth him hither on desperate venture. For fate had decreed</p>
			<p class="i0">That Aiolus’ line shall escape not the soul-afflicting ire</p>
			<p class="i0">Of implacable Zeus, and his wrath, and the curse unendurably dire,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the vengeance for Phrixus, till cometh to Hellas the Fleece of Gold.</p>
			<p class="i0">And his ship did Pallas Athênê fashion: not such is her mould</p>
			<p class="i0">As the fashioning is of the ships that be found ’mid the Kolchian folk⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Whereof our hap was the vilest, for even at a touch it broke</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the raging surge and the wind;⁠—but this ship holdeth fast,</p>
			<p class="i0">Gripped by her bolts, through the buffeting fury of every blast.</p>
			<p class="i0">And swiftly alike she runneth before the wind, and when</p>
			<p class="i0">She is sped by the oars unresting in hands of stalwart men.</p>
			<p class="i0">He hath gathered within her whatso mightiest heroes there are</p>
			<p class="i0">In Achaia-land, and hath come to thy city from wandering far</p>
			<p class="i0">By cities, by dread sea-gulfs, if thou haply wouldst grant his request,</p>
			<p class="i0">That the thing he desireth may be: for nowise he cometh to wrest</p>
			<p class="i0">Aught from thine hands by force: he is minded to pay unto thee</p>
			<p class="i0">Fair quittance for this thy gift. Of the bitter enmity</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the Sauromatai hath he heard; he will quell them to bow to thy sway.</p>
			<p class="i0">And their name and their lineage, if fain thou wouldst hear them, as thou dost say,</p>
			<p class="i0">What men they be, I will tell to thee all in order due.</p>
			<p class="i0">This man, for whose helping assembled from Hellas a hero-crew,</p>
			<p class="i0">Jason they call him, the son of Aison, Krêtheus’ seed.</p>
			<p class="i0">Now, if this man of Krêtheus’ lineage cometh in very deed,</p>
			<p class="i0">Of a truth by the father’s blood shall he be of kin unto us,</p>
			<p class="i0">For that Krêtheus and Athamas both were the children of Aiolus,</p>
			<p class="i0">And Phrixus moreover was child of Athamas, Aiolus’ son.</p>
			<p class="i0">And, if aught thou know’st of the Sun-god’s seed, lo, here is one,</p>
			<p class="i0">Augeias; and Telamon this, the son of the mighty in fame</p>
			<p class="i0">Aiakus; yea, and of Zeus’s loins great Aiakus came.</p>
			<p class="i0">And in like wise all the rest, which have hither companioned his way,</p>
			<p class="i0">The sons and the grandsons they are of the Gods which abide for aye.”</p>
			<p class="i1">So Argus spake: but the wrath of the king waxed hot as he heard,</p>
			<p class="i0">And his soul like a stormy sea with a tempest of fury was stirred.</p>
			<p class="i0">Fuming he spake⁠—with the sons of his daughter above the rest</p>
			<p class="i0">Was he wroth, for he weened that of these had Jason been moved to the Quest:</p>
			<p class="i0">And the light of his anger leapt from his eyes as levin-flame:</p>
			<p class="i1">“And will ye not straightway be gone from my sight, ye felons of shame,</p>
			<p class="i0">And depart from the land afar with the guile of your treachery,</p>
			<p class="i0">Ere a bitter Fleece and a bitter Phrixus here ye see,</p>
			<p class="i0">With your friends back faring to Hellas? Not for the Fleece come ye!</p>
			<p class="i0">Nay, but my sceptre and kingly honour ye come to take!</p>
			<p class="i0">Now, if ye had broken not bread at my table or ever ye spake,</p>
			<p class="i0">Your tongues had I surely cut out, and had hewn from the wrist each hand,</p>
			<p class="i0">And had sent you forth with naught but your feet to fare through the land:</p>
			<p class="i0">So should ye refrain you thereafter from coming on suchlike quest!⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Lo, and the lies ye have spoken concerning the Gods ever-blest!”</p>
			<p class="i1">So passioned the king: but even to its depths the spirit burned</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Aiakus’ son, and hotly his soul within him yearned</p>
			<p class="i0">To fling back a deadly defiance. But Jason, or ever he spake,</p>
			<p class="i0">Stayed him, and gently speaking an answer of peace did he make:</p>
			<p class="i1">“Bear with me, Aiêtes, as touching this Quest: no such wild dream</p>
			<p class="i0">To thy city and halls hath brought us as thou peradventure dost deem.</p>
			<p class="i0">Nought such do we covet:⁠—what man of his will, from an alien to wrest</p>
			<p class="i0">His possessions, would fare over such wide seas? By the ruthless behest</p>
			<p class="i0">Of a tyrannous king was I hitherward sent, and the doom of a God.</p>
			<p class="i0">Show favour to this our entreaty; and so will I publish abroad</p>
			<p class="i0">Thy name and thy glory all Hellas through. Yea, ready we are</p>
			<p class="i0">To render for this unto thee requital of service in war,</p>
			<p class="i0">Whether it be that ye fain would bow the Sauromatans’ pride</p>
			<p class="i0">Under your sceptred sway, or whatso nation beside.”</p>
			<p class="i1">Then ceased he, with gentle utterance proffering love: but the king</p>
			<p class="i0">A twofold purpose the while in his soul was pondering,</p>
			<p class="i0">Whether to make assault on them then and there, and to slay,</p>
			<p class="i0">Or to put their might to the test. And he counted the better way,</p>
			<p class="i0">Thus as he pondered, the second, and answered in subtlety:</p>
			<p class="i1">“Stranger, what hast thou to do to tell all this unto me?</p>
			<p class="i0">For if ye be seed of the Gods in truth, or if ye which have hied</p>
			<p class="i0">To the aliens’ land be peers of Aiêtes in aught beside,</p>
			<p class="i0">I will give thee to bear away, if thou wilt, the Fleece of Gold,</p>
			<p class="i0">When first I have tried thee. Nought I begrudge to the hero-souled,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even as ye tell me of him that in Hellas beareth sway.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the test of your valour and prowess shall be a certain essay,</p>
			<p class="i0">Which mine own hands compass, fraught though it be with deadly bane.</p>
			<p class="i0">Two brazen-footed bulls have I: on the War-god’s plain</p>
			<p class="i0">They pasture: the breath from their mouths in flames of fire doth stream.</p>
			<p class="i0">These yoke I, and drive through the War-god’s stubborn glebe that team,</p>
			<p class="i0">Four ploughgates; and even to the end my ploughshare cleaveth it fast.</p>
			<p class="i0">No seed of the Lady of Corn in the furrows thereof do I cast,</p>
			<p class="i0">But the teeth of a terrible serpent; and up from the earth they grow</p>
			<p class="i0">In fashion of armèd men; but straightway I lay them low</p>
			<p class="i0">With the thrusts of my spear, as around me they throng, a battle-ring.</p>
			<p class="i0">With the dawning I yoke my team, and I cease from mine harvesting</p>
			<p class="i0">At the eventide hour. And thou, if thou bring such deeds to pass,</p>
			<p class="i0">That day shalt win this Fleece, as thy king’s commandment was.</p>
			<p class="i0">But I give it thee not ere then; neither hope it; for shame should it be</p>
			<p class="i0">That a mighty champion should yield to a man that is worser than he.”</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake he: but silent the hero sat, with his eyes on the ground.</p>
			<p class="i0">Speechless he sat: no help for the desperate evil he found.</p>
			<p class="i0">Long time he communed with his heart; no way through the darkness gleamed</p>
			<p class="i0">To take on him stoutly the task, for a mighty deed it seemed.</p>
			<p class="i0">But late and at last he spake, and he answered warily:</p>
			<p class="i1">“Full straitly, Aiêtes, within thy right art thou shutting me.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet this will I dare, this emprise mighty beyond all thought;</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, though my doom be to die: for a man may light upon nought</p>
			<p class="i0">More dread to encounter than ruthless fate’s overmastering hand,</p>
			<p class="i0">Which hitherward also constrained me to come at a king’s command.”</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake he, filled with despair; but the king made answer to him,</p>
			<p class="i0">Sore troubled there as he sat, with words exceeding grim:</p>
			<p class="i1">“Come then to the gathering, thou who art fain this toil to essay.</p>
			<p class="i0">But if thou shalt fear on the necks of the oxen the yoke to lay,</p>
			<p class="i0">Or if from the deadly harvesting backward thou shrink in dismay,</p>
			<p class="i0">Then will I look unto this, that another, taught by thee,</p>
			<p class="i0">May shudder to come in such malapert sort to a mightier than he.”</p>
			<p class="i1">Roundly he spake, and he ceased; and Jason uprose from his seat,</p>
			<p class="i0">And Augeias and Telamon with him; but followed them only the feet</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Argus; for even at the moment a sign to his brethren he cast</p>
			<p class="i0">There in their place to tarry: so forth of the hall they passed.</p>
			<p class="i0">But the son of Aison outshone all there in wondrous wise</p>
			<p class="i0">In goodlihead and in grace: ever wandered the maiden’s eyes</p>
			<p class="i0">Askance unto him, as she stealthily parted her veil’s soft gleam.</p>
			<p class="i0">And her heart was a smouldering fire of pain; and her soul, as a dream,</p>
			<p class="i0">Stole after her love, flitting still in his track as his feet fared on.</p>
			<p class="i0">So they from the halls in exceeding vexation of spirit are gone.</p>
			<p class="i0">But Chalkiopê, from the wrath of Aiêtes shrinking in dread,</p>
			<p class="i0">Hastily unto her bower with those her sons had fled.</p>
			<p class="i0">And Medea thereafter followed; and surged like a rushing river</p>
			<p class="i0">The thoughts through her breast⁠—the thoughts that Love awakeneth ever.</p>
			<p class="i0">And before her eyes the vision of all evermore she had⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Himself, even like as he was, and the vesture wherein he was clad,</p>
			<p class="i0">How he spake, how he sat on his seat, how forth of the doors he strode,</p>
			<p class="i0">And she dreamed as she mused that all the world beside had showed</p>
			<p class="i0">None other such man. In her ears evermore the music rung</p>
			<p class="i0">Of his voice, and the words that in sweetness of honey had dropped from his tongue.</p>
			<p class="i0">And she trembled for him, lest the bulls or Aiêtes himself might slay</p>
			<p class="i0">Her beloved, and took up a mourning for him, as though he lay</p>
			<p class="i0">Dead even now; and adown her cheeks soft-stealing tears</p>
			<p class="i0">Flowed, of her measureless pity, her burden of haunting fears.</p>
			<p class="i0">And she mourned, and the low lamentation wailed from her tortured breast:</p>
			<p class="i1">“Why, wretch that I am, is this anguish upon me?⁠—or be he the best</p>
			<p class="i0">Of heroes, who now is to perish, or be he the vilest of all,</p>
			<p class="i0">Let him go to his doom!⁠—yet O that on him no scathe might fall!</p>
			<p class="i0">Oh might it be so, thou Daughter of Perseus, Goddess revered!</p>
			<p class="i0">Oh might he but win home, ’scaping his doom!⁠—but if this be his weird,</p>
			<p class="i0">By the bulls to be overmastered, or ever it be too late</p>
			<p class="i0">Might he know it, that I be not forced to exult o’er the thing that I hate!”</p>
			<p class="i1">So was the maiden distraught by the cares that racked her mind.</p>
			<p class="i0">But when those others had left the folk and the city behind,</p>
			<p class="i0">On the path whereby at the first from the river-plain they had gone,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even then, and with these words, Argus spake unto Aison’s son:</p>
			<p class="i1">“This counsel of mine, O Aison’s son, thou wilt haply despise:</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet in desperate strait to forbear from the trial seemeth not wise.</p>
			<p class="i0">Thou hast heard me tell of a maiden that practiseth sorcery</p>
			<p class="i0">Under the teaching of Perseus’ daughter Hekatê.</p>
			<p class="i0">Now if we might win her to help us, thou needest not fear any more</p>
			<p class="i0">To be vanquished in this thine endeavour:⁠—howbeit my fear is sore</p>
			<p class="i0">Lest haply my mother will take not upon her to move her thereto.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet in any wise back will I wend to essay what entreaty may do;</p>
			<p class="i0">For over us all alike is destruction hanging this day.”</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake he in kindness of heart, and in answer did Jason say:</p>
			<p class="i0">“Dear friend, if this seemeth good in thy sight, I say not nay.</p>
			<p class="i0">Hasten thou then, and with words of weight to thy mother pray</p>
			<p class="i0">Till thou stir her to help us:⁠—howbeit a pitiful hope is the best</p>
			<p class="i0">For our home-return, if this in the keeping of women must rest.”</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake he; and soon to the backwater came he: with hearts full fain</p>
			<p class="i0">Did their comrades greet them, and question, beholding them again.</p>
			<p class="i0">But unto them Aison’s son in heaviness spake the word:</p>
			<p class="i1">“O friends, the heart of Aiêtes the ruthless is wholly stirred</p>
			<p class="i0">With anger against us: of all those things whereof ye inquire</p>
			<p class="i0">Nor for me nor for you appeareth the goal of our desire.</p>
			<p class="i0">Two brazen-footed bulls on the War-god’s plain, he saith,</p>
			<p class="i0">Pasture; in flames of fire from the mouths of them streameth the breath:</p>
			<p class="i0">And with these must I plough him ploughgates four of a fallow field;</p>
			<p class="i0">And seed of a serpent’s jaws will he give, and for crop shall it yield</p>
			<p class="i0">Earth-born warriors in harness of brass. In the selfsame day</p>
			<p class="i0">These must I slay. And of this⁠—for I found no better way,</p>
			<p class="i0">In mine heart as I pondered⁠—I promised outright to make essay.”</p>
			<p class="i1">He spake, and it seemed unto all an impossible task. For a space</p>
			<p class="i0">Silent they sat, and each man gazed in his fellow’s face,</p>
			<p class="i0">By despair bowed down, by calamity crushed, till Peleus at last</p>
			<p class="i0">With stout words spake to hearten the heroes all aghast:</p>
			<p class="i1">“Full time is it now to be counselling what we shall do. In rede</p>
			<p class="i0">Small profit, I trow, shall be found; strong hands must help our need.</p>
			<p class="i0">If thou then art minded to yoke the bulls of Aiêtes the king,</p>
			<p class="i0">O hero Aison’s son, and thine heart is good for the thing,</p>
			<p class="i0">Up then, and keep thy promise, and gird up thy loins for the toil.</p>
			<p class="i0">But if aught thine heart mistrusteth her manhood, and feareth the foil,</p>
			<p class="i0">Neither goad thyself on, nor yet for another of these look round</p>
			<p class="i0">As thou sitt’st in their midst: for one that shall nowise flinch hath been found,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even I; for the bitterest pang is but death, to which all men are bound.”</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake Aiakus’ son; and Telamon’s spirit was stirred,</p>
			<p class="i0">And swiftly in haste he uprose; and Idas uprose for the third</p>
			<p class="i0">With heart uplifted; and rose the sons of Tyndareus then;</p>
			<p class="i0">And rose with them Oineus’ son, who was numbered among strong men,</p>
			<p class="i0">Albeit not yet so much as the tender down on his chin</p>
			<p class="i0">Showed; with such hero-might was his spirit uplifted within.</p>
			<p class="i0">But the rest unto these gave place, and were still: then spake straightway</p>
			<p class="i0">Argus to these for the contest that longed, and thus did he say:</p>
			<p class="i1">“Friends, haply to this may we come at the last: but ere that be,</p>
			<p class="i0">Help for our need shall be found with my mother, it seemeth me.</p>
			<p class="i0">Wherefore refrain you a little yet, how eager soe’er,</p>
			<p class="i0">And abide in the ship as aforetime: for better it is to forbear,</p>
			<p class="i0">Than reckless-hearted to choose the path to destruction’s lair.</p>
			<p class="i0">In the halls of Aiêtes nurtured a certain maiden doth dwell</p>
			<p class="i0">Whom Hekatê taught strange cunning in herbs of the witch-wife’s spell,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even all that on solid land or in fleeting water grow.</p>
			<p class="i0">And therewith she turneth to balm the fireblast’s fervent glow,</p>
			<p class="i0">And rivers in mid rush roaring she suddenly causeth to stand,</p>
			<p class="i0">And constraineth the stars and the paths of the holy moon with a band.</p>
			<p class="i0">Of her we bethought us, the while from the palace we trod the way,</p>
			<p class="i0">If haply my mother, seeing that sisters born be they,</p>
			<p class="i0">Could persuade this maiden, that so for the contest her help she may lend.</p>
			<p class="i0">And if this thing appeareth good in your eyes, of a truth will I wend</p>
			<p class="i0">To the palace-hall of Aiêtes aback this selfsame day</p>
			<p class="i0">To try her:⁠—a God peradventure will help when I make essay.”</p>
			<p class="i1">He spake, and the Gods of their kindness sent forth a sign in their sight;</p>
			<p class="i0">For a fearful dove from the might of a hawk swift-winging her flight</p>
			<p class="i0">From on high into Jason’s bosom fell in her panic affright.</p>
			<p class="i0">But the hawk swooped blindly, and fluttered impaled on the high stern-crest.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then on Mopsus a spirit of prophecy came, and he cried to the rest:</p>
			<p class="i1">“Unto you, O friends, by the will of the Gods this token is sent;</p>
			<p class="i0">For in none other wise shall ye better interpret the sign’s intent</p>
			<p class="i0">That we seek to the maiden, and woo her with speech of entreaty fair</p>
			<p class="i0">With our uttermost wit; and I ween she will not reject our prayer,</p>
			<p class="i0">If Phineus foretold that your home-return should be brought to pass</p>
			<p class="i0">With help of the Cyprian Goddess. Her gentle bird it was</p>
			<p class="i0">That escaped from destruction. As now mine heart doth in vision foresee</p>
			<p class="i0">As touching this omen, O that so in the end it may be!</p>
			<p class="i0">Friends, let us cry to the Queen of Kythera to help our need;</p>
			<p class="i0">And straightway obey ye the counsel of Argus with diligent heed.”</p>
			<p class="i1">He spake, and the young men praised it, calling to mind the word</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Phineus the prophet; but Idas alone rose anger-stirred</p>
			<p class="i0">Shouting aloud in his fierceness of wrath, and thus did he say:</p>
			<p class="i1">“Out on it!⁠—were women our voyaging-fellows through all that way?</p>
			<p class="i0">We men that be calling on Kypris now for our help to arise,</p>
			<p class="i0">And not on the War-god’s mighty strength?⁠—and by turning your eyes</p>
			<p class="i0">On doves and on hawks shall ye ’scape from the toil, shall ye win the prize?</p>
			<p class="i0">Away!⁠—let the deeds of war no more in your hearts find place,</p>
			<p class="i0">But the cunning in pleading that winneth a weakling maiden’s grace!”</p>
			<p class="i1">Even so hot-hearted he spake; and many of them that heard</p>
			<p class="i0">Low murmured thereat; howbeit none of them answered a word.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then sat he down yet scowling in wrath; and rose thereupon</p>
			<p class="i0">Jason to stir them to deeds, and thus spake Aison’s son:</p>
			<p class="i1">“Let Argus be sent from the ship, seeing all commend this thing;</p>
			<p class="i0">But let us which remain from her hiding-place in the river bring</p>
			<p class="i0">And openly moor to the shore our galley; for now gone by</p>
			<p class="i0">Is the time for hiding as cravens that cower from the onset-cry.”</p>
			<p class="i1">So did he speak: and he hasted the feet of Argus again</p>
			<p class="i0">To return to the city with speed, and the hawsers drew they then</p>
			<p class="i0">Out of the stream inboard at Aison’s son’s command;</p>
			<p class="i0">And a little above the backwater rowed they the galley aland.</p>
			<p class="i1">But Aiêtes assembled for council the Kolchian men in haste</p>
			<p class="i0">Aloof from his halls, in the place where they gathered in days overpast,</p>
			<p class="i0">Devising against the Minyans trouble and treachery grim.</p>
			<p class="i0">And he purposed, so soon as the bulls should have torn him limb from limb⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">This man who had taken upon him the heavy task to fulfil⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">To hew the oak-grove down that crested the shaggy hill,</p>
			<p class="i0">And to burn the ship and her crew, that so amid fume and flame</p>
			<p class="i0">They might vent that insolence forth for a king’s defiance that came.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, and he had not received, he said, even Aiolus’ son</p>
			<p class="i0">In his halls in his sorest need, even Phrixus, the man who outshone</p>
			<p class="i0">All strangers in courtesy and in fear of the Gods on high,</p>
			<p class="i0">But that Zeus’ self sent unto him his messenger down from the sky,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even Hermes, bidding him give to the stranger the welcoming hand.</p>
			<p class="i0">How much less therefore, when pirate-rovers came to his land,</p>
			<p class="i0">Should they long ’scape griefs of their own, the caitiffs whose only toil</p>
			<p class="i0">Was to stretch forth their hands in the taking of other men’s goods for a spoil,</p>
			<p class="i0">And to weave dark webs of guile, and on herdmen folk to fall</p>
			<p class="i0">With soul-dismaying shouts, and to harry steading and stall?</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, and the sons of Phrixus should render to him therebeside</p>
			<p class="i0">Meet penalty, they who had dared in returning thither to guide</p>
			<p class="i0">Felons, consorting with men which were minded to drive even him</p>
			<p class="i0">Light-hearted from honour and sceptre; as spake that prophecy grim,</p>
			<p class="i0">The warning whereof he heard from his father the Sun erewhile,</p>
			<p class="i0">Bidding him, “See thou beware of thine offspring’s secret guile,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the plots of thy seed, and the curse of their crafty iniquity;”</p>
			<p class="i0">For which cause also he sent them, even as they craved, oversea,</p>
			<p class="i0">By their father’s behest, to Achaia a long way:⁠—yet there came</p>
			<p class="i0">On his soul no shadow of fear of his daughters, lest these should frame</p>
			<p class="i0">Treason: no fear of his son Absyrtus his heart had chilled;</p>
			<p class="i0">But he said, “In the children of Chalkiopê shall the curse be fulfilled.”</p>
			<p class="i0">And bodings of awful revenge on the strangers foamed on his lip</p>
			<p class="i0">In his fury; for loudly he threatened to hale to the flames their ship</p>
			<p class="i0">And her crew, that none through the meshes of ruin’s net might slip.</p>
			<p class="i0">But Argus had gone to the halls of Aiêtes the while, and with speech</p>
			<p class="i0">Of manifold pleading now did the prince his mother beseech</p>
			<p class="i0">To pray to Medea to help them; yea, and herself theretofore</p>
			<p class="i0">Was full of the selfsame thought, but the fear on her soul lay sore</p>
			<p class="i0">Lest haply fate should withstand, and in vain she should speak her fair,</p>
			<p class="i0">For her dread of her father’s deadly wrath; or if to her prayer</p>
			<p class="i0">She should yield, yet all should be brought to light, and her deeds laid bare.</p>
			<p class="i1">Now the maiden had cast her down on her couch, and slumber deep</p>
			<p class="i0">Of her anguish relieved her; but straightway dreams came haunting her sleep,</p>
			<p class="i0">Such visions dark and deceitful as trouble the anguish-distraught.</p>
			<p class="i0">For it seemed that the stranger had taken upon him the task; but she thought</p>
			<p class="i0">That it was not the Fleece of the Ram that he longed to win for a prize,</p>
			<p class="i0">Nor yet for the sake of this had he fared in any wise</p>
			<p class="i0">To Aiêtes’ city, but only to lead her, his wedded wife,</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto his home; and she dreamed that herself did wrestle in strife</p>
			<p class="i0">With the bulls, and exceeding lightly the mighty labour she wrought.</p>
			<p class="i0">Howbeit thereafter her parents set their promise at naught,</p>
			<p class="i0">For that not to their child, but to him, was the challenge to yoke that team.</p>
			<p class="i0">Wherefore contention of wrangling clashed through her troubled dream</p>
			<p class="i0">’Twixt her sire and the strangers: and lo, in her hand the decision they laid,</p>
			<p class="i0">That the issue should follow her will, and the thoughts of the heart of the maid.</p>
			<p class="i0">And straightway the stranger she chose: all reverence thrust she aside</p>
			<p class="i0">For her parents; and measureless anguish seized them, and loud they cried</p>
			<p class="i0">In their fury, and sleep forsook her at that heart-thrilling sound.</p>
			<p class="i0">And all a-quiver with fear she upstarted: she stared all round</p>
			<p class="i0">On the walls of her chamber; her fluttering spirit back to her breast</p>
			<p class="i0">Scarce drew she: the words like a panic-struck throng through her pale lips pressed:</p>
			<p class="i1">“O wretched I!⁠—how nightmare visions my spirit appal!</p>
			<p class="i0">I fear me lest awful ills from the heroes’ voyage befall:</p>
			<p class="i0">And my heart, my heart for the stranger is tossed in a storm of dismay.</p>
			<p class="i0">Let him woo some girl in his own Achaia far away,</p>
			<p class="i0">And be maidenhood mine, and mine in the house of my parents to stay!</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet⁠—yet⁠—though mine heart be by love made reckless, the desperate deed</p>
			<p class="i0">I will try not unbid by my sister⁠—never!⁠—except she plead</p>
			<p class="i0">With Medea to help in the toil, in her anguish of fear for the sake</p>
			<p class="i0">Of her sons: this might peradventure assuage my sore heart-ache.”</p>
			<p class="i1">She spake, and she rose from her bed, and she opened her chamber door</p>
			<p class="i0">Barefooted, in vesture of linen alone; and she yearned full sore</p>
			<p class="i0">To go to her sister, and over the threshold stole the maid:</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet lingering⁠—lingering⁠—long at the door of the chamber she stayed</p>
			<p class="i0">Held by her shame. Then backward in sudden panic she fled,</p>
			<p class="i0">And into her bower she darted, and shrank to the shadows in dread.</p>
			<p class="i0">And backward and forward her purposeless feet ever paced in vain;</p>
			<p class="i0">For whenso she braced her to go, shame fettered her feet with its chain,</p>
			<p class="i0">And ever as shame plucked back, bold passion spurred her amain.</p>
			<p class="i0">Thrice she essayed, thrice stayed she; but now at the fourth essay</p>
			<p class="i0">Down on her bed on her face did she cast her, and writhing she lay.</p>
			<p class="i0">And as when some bride in her desolate bower for her lord maketh moan,</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto whom her brethren and parents espoused her a little agone;</p>
			<p class="i0">And for shame and for thinking on him awhile she cannot face</p>
			<p class="i0">The eyes of her handmaids, but silent she sits in a secret place.</p>
			<p class="i0">Some doom hath destroyed him, or ever the crown of their desire</p>
			<p class="i0">Was attained of these: and there in her chamber, with heart on fire</p>
			<p class="i0">Stilly she sitteth and weepeth, beholding her couch left lorn;</p>
			<p class="i0">Stilly⁠—for fear of the mock of the women, the laugh of their scorn</p>
			<p class="i0">Like her did Medea make moan: but with sob and with broken cry</p>
			<p class="i0">While yet she lamented, it chanced one heard as she passed thereby,</p>
			<p class="i0">Which had been from a child a handmaid tending her lady’s bower</p>
			<p class="i0">So she told it to Chalkiopê: now she sat in the selfsame hour</p>
			<p class="i0">With her sons, devising to win her sister to help their need;</p>
			<p class="i0">And she hearkened the strange tale told of the handmaid with diligent heed,</p>
			<p class="i0">Neither put it lightly aside; but she hastened in startled dismay</p>
			<p class="i0">Forth of her bower and on to the bower where the maiden lay</p>
			<p class="i0">Anguish-racked, while her frenzied fingers tore each cheek.</p>
			<p class="i0">And her eyes all drowned in tears she beheld, and thus did she speak:</p>
			<p class="i1">“Ah me, Medea, ah me!⁠—and why art thou weeping so?</p>
			<p class="i0">What hath befallen?⁠—how came to thine heart this terrible woe?</p>
			<p class="i0">Is it some disease heaven-sent that hath suddenly smitten thy frame?</p>
			<p class="i0">Or what, hast thou heard some deadly threat from our father that came</p>
			<p class="i0">Touching me and my sons? Would God I had never so much as seen</p>
			<p class="i0">My parents’ home, nor the town, but my dwelling afar had been</p>
			<p class="i0">At the ends of the earth, where never was heard the Kolchian name!”</p>
			<p class="i1">She spake: but Medea’s cheeks flushed crimson; and maiden shame</p>
			<p class="i0">From the answer she yearned full sore to render withheld her long.</p>
			<p class="i0">And now was the word awake, and fluttered upon her tongue,</p>
			<p class="i0">And backward anon to her breast it flew like a startled bird.</p>
			<p class="i0">And often she parted her lovely lips to utter the word;</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet fainted her voice on the threshold of speech: but at last of her guile</p>
			<p class="i0">Thus spake she⁠—and ever the bold Loves thrust her onward the while:</p>
			<p class="i1">“O Chalkiopê, mine heart for thy sons is disquieted sore,</p>
			<p class="i0">Lest my father destroy them forthright with the men from the alien shore;</p>
			<p class="i0">So ghastly a dream, while a moment I slumbered, but now did I see⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">And oh may the Gods forefend that the vision accomplished should be,</p>
			<p class="i0">Forbid that thy love for thy sons should be made heart-anguish to thee!”</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake she, proving her sister, longing to hear her pray,</p>
			<p class="i0">Unprompted of her, for her help for her sons in the evil day.</p>
			<p class="i0">Strong anguish swept o’er the mother’s soul like a surging tide,</p>
			<p class="i0">For her terror at that she had heard, and with fervent beseeching she cried:</p>
			<p class="i1">“Yea, and to this same end did I come with eager speed,</p>
			<p class="i0">If with me thou wouldst haply devise and prepare some help for our need.</p>
			<p class="i0">But swear thou by Earth and by Heaven that thou wilt conceal in thine heart</p>
			<p class="i0">Whatsoever I say unto thee, and wilt bear therein thy part.</p>
			<p class="i0">By the Blessèd I pray thee, by thine own soul, by thy parents’ name,</p>
			<p class="i0">That thou see not my sons in torment destroyed by a doom of shame</p>
			<p class="i0">Horribly: else with my dear-loved sons will I die, and come</p>
			<p class="i0">A hateful vengeance-spirit to haunt thee from Hades’ home!”</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake she, and straightway gushed her tears in torrent flow;</p>
			<p class="i0">And around her knees did she fling her arms in a passion of woe,</p>
			<p class="i0">And adown on her bosom she bowed her head; and there they two</p>
			<p class="i0">Over each other made piteous lament, and the dim halls through</p>
			<p class="i0">Went wailing low the sound of anguished women’s cry.</p>
			<p class="i0">And to her disquieted sorely Medea made reply:</p>
			<p class="i1">“God help thee!⁠—what healing can I bring thee?⁠—what talk is thine</p>
			<p class="i0">Of horrible curses and vengeance-spirits!⁠—would God it were mine,</p>
			<p class="i0">Mine by a power firm-stablished, to save thy sons from bane!</p>
			<p class="i0">Be witness⁠—the mighty oath of the Kolchians, the oath thou art fain</p>
			<p class="i0">I should swear⁠—be witness the broad-arched Heaven, and the Earth below,</p>
			<p class="i0">Mother of Gods, that, so far as the bounds of my strength may go,</p>
			<p class="i0">I will fail thee not, if thy prayer be a boon that man may bestow.”</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake she, and Chalkiopê made answer to her, and she said:</p>
			<p class="i0">“Now couldst thou not dare for the stranger⁠—himself too asketh thine aid⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">By wile or by wisdom achievement of this emprise to win</p>
			<p class="i0">For the sake of my sons? Lo, now is his messenger Argus within,</p>
			<p class="i0">Praying that I would essay to win for them help of thy grace.</p>
			<p class="i0">In the mid-court left I him when I came to seek thy face.”</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake she, and bounded within her Medea’s heart for delight:</p>
			<p class="i0">Her fair skin suddenly crimsoned, and swam before her sight</p>
			<p class="i0">A mist, as she flushed and burned; and answer she made thereunto:</p>
			<p class="i1">“Chalkiopê, according to that which is pleasing to you,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even so will I do. May I see with mine eyes the dawn not again,</p>
			<p class="i0">Nor mayst thou behold me long in the land of living men,</p>
			<p class="i0">If I count aught dearer to me than the lives of thee and thine,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even thy sons: for verily these be brethren mine,</p>
			<p class="i0">My kinsmen belovèd, my childhood-playmates: myself I call</p>
			<p class="i0">Thine own, own sister, my sister’s own little daughter withal,</p>
			<p class="i0">Since even as them the baby me to thy breast didst thou hold:</p>
			<p class="i0">So still have I heard the tale by the lips of my mother told.</p>
			<p class="i0">But go thou, in silence bury this my kindness, that so</p>
			<p class="i0">I may work out unwares to my parents my promise. At dawn will I go</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto Hekatê’s fane, to bear thither the drugs that shall cast a spell</p>
			<p class="i0">On the bulls for the stranger for whose sake all this strife befell.”</p>
			<p class="i1">So the mother returned from the chamber, and spake to her sons full fain</p>
			<p class="i0">Of her sister’s help. But now did the tide of shame again</p>
			<p class="i0">And of terrible fear o’er the soul of Medea in solitude rise,</p>
			<p class="i0">That she in her sire’s despite for a man such deeds should devise.</p>
			<p class="i1">Then night drew darkness over the earth; on the lonely sea</p>
			<p class="i0">The sailors gazed from their ships on the Bear and the flashing three</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Orion; and came upon every wayfarer longing for sleep,</p>
			<p class="i0">And on each gate-warder; and mothers, that daylong wont to weep</p>
			<p class="i0">For children dead, with the peace of slumber were folded around.</p>
			<p class="i0">No barking of dogs through the city there was any more, no sound</p>
			<p class="i0">Of voices, but all the blackening gloom was with silence bound.</p>
			<p class="i0">But not o’er Medea did sleep sweet dews of forgetfulness shake;</p>
			<p class="i0">For many a care in her yearning for Jason held her awake,</p>
			<p class="i0">Adread of the mighty strength of the bulls, ’neath the fury of whom</p>
			<p class="i0">He must die in the War-god’s acre, must die by a shameful doom.</p>
			<p class="i0">And with thick fast throbbings struggled the heart in her breast alway;</p>
			<p class="i0">As when on the wall of a dwelling the leaping sunbeams play</p>
			<p class="i0">Flung up from the water that into a caldron but now fell plashing,</p>
			<p class="i0">Or into a pail, and hither and thither the sunbeam flashing</p>
			<p class="i0">In lightning eddy and flicker is dancing in mad unrest,</p>
			<p class="i0">So quivered and fluttered the heart within the maiden’s breast.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the tears from her eyes were flowing for ruth, and through all her frame</p>
			<p class="i0">Like a smouldering fire her anguish burned, and coiled its flame</p>
			<p class="i0">Round every fine-strung nerve, and thrilled to her beating brain</p>
			<p class="i0">Where sharpest of all the pang strikes in, when the shafts of pain</p>
			<p class="i0">Are shot to the heart by the Loves that rest them never from harm.</p>
			<p class="i0">And now did she say that the drugs she would give that should bind with a charm</p>
			<p class="i0">The bulls, and now would she not, but with him would she cease to live.</p>
			<p class="i0">Swift changed her mood: she would not die, she, nor the drugs would she give,</p>
			<p class="i0">But in silence endure her fate, the curse that was doomed to betide.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then, there as she sat, she wavered this way and that, and she cried:</p>
			<p class="i1">“Oh hapless I, whether this way or that into ruin I fall!</p>
			<p class="i0">On every hand is despair for my soul: no help is at all</p>
			<p class="i0">From woe, but it burneth, a furnace unquenchèd!⁠—would God it had been</p>
			<p class="i0">Mine to be slain ere this by the shafts of the Huntress-queen,</p>
			<p class="i0">Or ever I saw him, or came to Achaia-land the sons</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Chalkiopê, whom a God, or the awful Avenging Ones</p>
			<p class="i0">Hither, for sorrow to us, and for many a tear, have led!</p>
			<p class="i0">—Let him perish amidst of the struggle, if this be his weird, to be sped</p>
			<p class="i0">On the fallows of doom!⁠—for how shall I ’scape my parents’ ken</p>
			<p class="i0">As the drugs I prepare? With what manner of words shall I blind them then?</p>
			<p class="i0">What wile, what cunning device for mine hero’s help shall I find?</p>
			<p class="i0">If I see him apart from his friends, shall I meet him with greeting kind?</p>
			<p class="i0">O ill-starred!⁠—though he should die, yet cannot I hope that so</p>
			<p class="i0">Assuaging should come of my pain: nay, this should be but for my woe</p>
			<p class="i0">If he of his life were bereft⁠—oh, get thee behind me, shame!</p>
			<p class="i0">Beauty, avaunt!⁠—So scatheless by mine endeavour he came</p>
			<p class="i0">Out of peril, then might he fare wheresoever seemeth him best.</p>
			<p class="i0">But for me⁠—on the selfsame day when triumphant he bideth the test,</p>
			<p class="i0">Then let me die, from the rafters straining my neck in the noose,</p>
			<p class="i0">Or tasting of poisons that rend the soul from the body loose.</p>
			<p class="i0">Ah, but after my dying!⁠—what scoffs and what mocks will they fling</p>
			<p class="i0">On my grave!⁠—and far and near how every city will ring</p>
			<p class="i0">With the tale of my doom; and from lip to lip shall be tossed the jeer,</p>
			<p class="i0">And a mock shall I be in the mouths of the daughters of Kolchis that sneer,</p>
			<p class="i0">‘Lo, she that so lovingly cared for a man of an alien race</p>
			<p class="i0">That she died!⁠—lo, she that on home and on parents heaped disgrace,</p>
			<p class="i0">Giving reins to her lust!’ What shame should not be loaded on me?</p>
			<p class="i0">Ah me, my infatuate folly!⁠—better by far should it be</p>
			<p class="i0">In this same night to forsake my life these chambers within</p>
			<p class="i0">By a fate of mystery, ’scaping from slander’s fiendish din,</p>
			<p class="i0">Or ever that hideous befouling, that nameless defilement, I win!”</p>
			<p class="i1">She spake, and she rose, and a casket she brought, wherein there lay</p>
			<p class="i0">Many a drug, some helpful to heal, some mighty to slay.</p>
			<p class="i0">On her knees she laid it, and brake into weeping: her bosom-fold</p>
			<p class="i0">Was wet with her tears; from the wounds unstanched of her heart they rolled,</p>
			<p class="i0">As she bitterly wailed for her fate: and her soul was exceeding fain</p>
			<p class="i0">To choose her a murderous drug, and to taste oblivion of pain.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the eager fingers now of the hapless maid ’gan part</p>
			<p class="i0">The bands of the casket, to take it forth⁠—but, with sudden start,</p>
			<p class="i0">With an awful fear of Hades the hateful shuddered her heart.</p>
			<p class="i0">Long spellbound sat she in speechless horror: around her thronged</p>
			<p class="i0">Visions of all sweet things for the which through life she had longed.</p>
			<p class="i0">She thought of the hours delightsome the lot of the living that fill,</p>
			<p class="i0">And she thought of her merry playmates, even as a maiden will.</p>
			<p class="i0">And sweeter than ever was grown the sun unto her to behold⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">No marvel, seeing she yearned for all so passionate-souled!</p>
			<p class="i0">So she put from her knees the casket, and laid it down again</p>
			<p class="i0">All changed by the promptings of Hêrê: no more did she waver then</p>
			<p class="i0">In her purpose; but now did she long for the dawning with speed to awake,</p>
			<p class="i0">For the dayspring to rise, that so to her hero the drugs she might take</p>
			<p class="i0">For the spell, as her covenant pledged her, and meet him face to face.</p>
			<p class="i0">And many a time she unbarred the doors of her chamber, to gaze</p>
			<p class="i0">Forth for the far faint gleam, and welcome flashed upon her</p>
			<p class="i0">The Child of the Mist, and throughout the city the folk ’gan stir.</p>
			<p class="i1">Then Argus spake to his brethren, bidding them there to abide</p>
			<p class="i0">To learn the mind of the maiden, and how should her purpose betide;</p>
			<p class="i0">But himself turned backward again, and unto the galley he hied.</p>
			<p class="i1">Now soon as the maiden beheld the splendour of dawn outrolled</p>
			<p class="i0">O’er the heavens, gathered she up with her hands her tresses of gold,</p>
			<p class="i0">Which over her shoulders in careless disarray hung loose:</p>
			<p class="i0">And she bathed her feverish cheeks, and with perfume shed from the cruse</p>
			<p class="i0">All nectar-scented her body shone; and a robe fair-wrought</p>
			<p class="i0">She donned, and with brooches cunningly-fashioned its folds upcaught.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the cloud of a veil did she cast o’er her head unearthly fair,</p>
			<p class="i0">And as silver it shimmered: she trode the floors of the palace there</p>
			<p class="i0">Pacing unfaltering to and fro, forgetful of all</p>
			<p class="i0">Those heaven-sent woes at the door, and of others that yet should befall.</p>
			<p class="i0">And she summoned her bower-maidens; twelve by tale were they:</p>
			<p class="i0">Through the night at the entering-in of her odorous chamber they lay,</p>
			<p class="i0">Young as herself, nor yet on the bridal couch embraced.</p>
			<p class="i0">And these she commanded to harness the mules to the wain in haste</p>
			<p class="i0">To bear their lady to Hekatê’s passing-beautiful fane.</p>
			<p class="i0">Wherefore the bower-maidens hasted and harnessed the mules to the wain.</p>
			<p class="i0">And Medea the while took forth from the casket a drug of might,</p>
			<p class="i0">The magic root that they say is the Herb of Prometheus hight.</p>
			<p class="i0">For if any with midnight sacrifice upon Daira shall call,</p>
			<p class="i0">The only-begotten, and smear his body therewithal,</p>
			<p class="i0">No stroke of brazen weapon shall wound the flesh of him,</p>
			<p class="i0">No, nor from blazing fire shall he flinch; but his strength of limb</p>
			<p class="i0">And his prowess throughout that day shall all their might confound.</p>
			<p class="i0">First-born it upshot from the clod in the hour when dropped to the ground</p>
			<p class="i0">From the ravening eagle’s beak, where the crags of Caucasus frowned,</p>
			<p class="i0">The ichor, the blood of a God, of Prometheus in torments bound.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the flower of it blossomed a cubit the face of the earth above:</p>
			<p class="i0">As the glow of the crocus Corycian, so was the hue thereof,</p>
			<p class="i0">Upborne upon pale stalks twain, and below in its earthy bed</p>
			<p class="i0">The root thereof as flesh new-severed was crimson-red.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the blood thereof, like a mountain-oak’s dark sap, in a shell</p>
			<p class="i0">From Caspian strand she gathered, to weave thereof a spell,</p>
			<p class="i0">When seven times she had bathed her in waters unresting that glide,</p>
			<p class="i0">And seven times upon Brimo the Nursing-mother had cried⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Night-wandering Brimo, the Underworld Goddess, the Queen of the dead⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">And in dusky vesture clad through the blackness of night did she tread.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the dark earth shuddered and quaked deep down with muttering moan,</p>
			<p class="i0">As the Titan root was severed; yea, and Iapetus’ son</p>
			<p class="i0">In frenzy of heart-wringing agony groaned a fearful groan.</p>
			<p class="i0">This, from the casket ta’en, in her odorous girdle she laid,</p>
			<p class="i0">The girdle enclasping the waist divinely sweet of the maid.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then forth of the portal she paced, and she set her foot on the wain,</p>
			<p class="i0">And beside her went upon either hand bower-maidens twain.</p>
			<p class="i0">To her left hand gave they the reins, and the fair-fashioned whip hath she ta’en</p>
			<p class="i0">In her right; and adown through the city she drave; and the rest of the train</p>
			<p class="i0">Of her handmaids laid their hands on the wain, behind it to run</p>
			<p class="i0">Adown the highway broad, for their tunics delicate-spun</p>
			<p class="i0">Each maiden had kilted up above her ivory knee.</p>
			<p class="i0">’Twas as when, where Parthenius’ soft-flowing ripples slide through the lea,</p>
			<p class="i0">Or as when, coming up from her bath in Amnisus’ crystalline water,</p>
			<p class="i0">High-borne on her golden chariot rideth Latona’s Daughter,</p>
			<p class="i0">Driving betwixt the hills the fleetfoot roes of her car,</p>
			<p class="i0">To greet the sacrifice-steam of a hecatomb afar;</p>
			<p class="i0">And the Nymphs in throngs upon throngs attend her, gathering some</p>
			<p class="i0">By the green well-head of Amnisus’ self, and others that come</p>
			<p class="i0">By the glens and the fountain-flashing heights; and fawn and whine</p>
			<p class="i0">The cowering beasts, as onward cometh the presence divine:</p>
			<p class="i0">So through the city they sped, and to this side and that of the street</p>
			<p class="i0">The people made way, neither dared they the eyes of the princess to meet.</p>
			<p class="i0">But when she had left behind her the city’s fair-paved ways,</p>
			<p class="i0">And was now drawn nigh, as she drave through the plain, to the holy place,</p>
			<p class="i0">Then from the smooth-running wain she stept to the earth straightway</p>
			<p class="i0">In haste; and unto her maidens thus did Medea say:</p>
			<p class="i1">“O friends, I have verily grievously sinned, for I took no thought</p>
			<p class="i0">To have nought to do with the strangers whose wandering feet have sought</p>
			<p class="i0">Our land:⁠—lo now, with amazement’s perplexity smitten sore</p>
			<p class="i0">Is all the city, that none of the women, which heretofore</p>
			<p class="i0">Hitherward have assembled day by day, be now gathered here.</p>
			<p class="i0">But seeing that we be come, and that none beside draweth near,</p>
			<p class="i0">Come then, with delightsome song without stint or stay let us sing</p>
			<p class="i0">To our soul’s satisfying, and pluck we the lovely flowers that spring</p>
			<p class="i0">Mid the tender grass; and in this same hour on the homeward way</p>
			<p class="i0">Will we wend. Ye also with many a gift shall return this day</p>
			<p class="i0">Homeward, if now with mine heart’s desire ye will gladden me.</p>
			<p class="i0">For the pleading of Argus prevaileth with me, and of Chalkiopê:⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">But hide in your hearts that ye hear from me; let your lips be dumb,</p>
			<p class="i0">Lest to my father’s ears peradventure the story should come:⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">They beseech me to take rich gifts, and to save in his emprise fell</p>
			<p class="i0">Yon stranger who took it upon him the might of the bulls to quell.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, and their counsel was good in mine eyes, that I bade him appear</p>
			<p class="i0">In my presence this day, alone, with none of his comrades near,</p>
			<p class="i0">That we may divide those presents amongst us, if haply he bring</p>
			<p class="i0">The gifts in his hand, and may give him a spell-drug, a balefuller thing</p>
			<p class="i0">Than the strength of the bulls. But stand ye aloof when he draweth anigh.”</p>
			<p class="i0">So spake she, and pleased them all her counsel of subtlety.</p>
			<p class="i1">Now Argus apart from his comrades had sundered Aison’s son,</p>
			<p class="i0">So soon as he heard from his brethren how that Medea had gone</p>
			<p class="i0">Forth in the misty dawning to fare unto Hekatê’s fane;</p>
			<p class="i0">And over the plain did he lead him, and Mopsus companioned the twain,</p>
			<p class="i0">Ampykus’ son, most wise to interpret the tokens aright</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the coming of birds, and the signs to discern of their parting flight.</p>
			<p class="i1">Never yet had there been such a man in the days of the men of old⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Nor of them of the lineage of Zeus, nor the champions hero-souled</p>
			<p class="i0">Which sprang from the blood of the rest of the Gods that endure for aye⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Such a man as the bride of Zeus made Jason to be that day</p>
			<p class="i0">In glory of bodily presence, in witchery of his tongue.</p>
			<p class="i0">And ever his comrades gazing upon him in wonderment hung</p>
			<p class="i0">On his radiance of manifold grace: and glad for the way they should wend</p>
			<p class="i0">Waxed Ampykus’ son, as foreboding, I trow, how all should end.</p>
			<p class="i1">Now there is by the path through the plain, as ye draw to the temple anigh,</p>
			<p class="i0">A poplar that waveth his tresses of countless leaves on high;</p>
			<p class="i0">And thereon had the crows ever-babbling pitched as it were their tent,</p>
			<p class="i0">Whereof one, clapping her pinions, beneath her as these twain went,</p>
			<p class="i0">The counsel of Hêrê chanted, mid high boughs swayed to and fro:</p>
			<p class="i1">“Lo there, what a pitiful seer!⁠—even that which the children know</p>
			<p class="i0">His wit can in no wise conceive, how that no word sweet and dear</p>
			<p class="i0">Maiden will murmur to man, while strangers be loitering near!</p>
			<p class="i0">Avaunt, vile prophet and witless!⁠—on thee not the Cyprian Queen,</p>
			<p class="i0">On thee not the gentle Loves of their kindness are breathing, I ween!”</p>
			<p class="i1">So ceased the voice of her chiding, and Mopsus smiled to hear</p>
			<p class="i0">The heaven-sent cry of the bird, and spake to the heroes the seer:</p>
			<p class="i1">“Now pass thou on to the Goddess’s temple: therein shalt thou find</p>
			<p class="i0">The maiden, O Aison’s son: thou shalt prove her passing kind</p>
			<p class="i0">By the promptings of Kypris, who also thine helper shall be in thy toil,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even as prophesied Phineus, Agênor’s son, erewhile.</p>
			<p class="i0">But we twain, Argus and I, thy coming again will abide</p>
			<p class="i0">Aloof, yea, in this same place: but thou, with none beside,</p>
			<p class="i0">With wise words plead with the maiden, and win her thy will to do.”</p>
			<p class="i0">So in his wisdom he spake, and the others consented thereto.</p>
			<p class="i1">But Medea⁠—her thoughts unto nought else turned, upon nought could be stayed,</p>
			<p class="i0">Howsoever she sang⁠—but never a song, howsoe’er she essayed,</p>
			<p class="i0">Pleased her, that long its melody winged her feet for the dance;</p>
			<p class="i0">But ever she faltered amidst them, her eyes ever wandered askance</p>
			<p class="i0">Away from the throng of her maidens unresting; and over the ways,</p>
			<p class="i0">Turning aside her cheeks, far off ever strained she her gaze.</p>
			<p class="i0">O the heart in her breast oft fainted, whenever in fancy she heard</p>
			<p class="i0">Fleet past her the sound of a footfall, the breath of a breeze as it stirred.</p>
			<p class="i0">But it was not long ere the hero appeared to her yearning eyes</p>
			<p class="i0">Stately striding, as out of the ocean doth Sirius uprise,</p>
			<p class="i0">Who climbeth the sky most glorious and clear to discern from afar,</p>
			<p class="i0">But unto the flocks for measureless mischief a baleful star:</p>
			<p class="i0">Even so came Aison’s son to the maiden glorious to see⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">But with Jason’s appearing dawned on her troublous misery.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then it seemed as her heart dropped out of her bosom; a dark mist came</p>
			<p class="i0">Over her eyes, and hot in her cheeks did the blushes flame.</p>
			<p class="i0">Nor backward nor forward a step could she stir: all strength was gone</p>
			<p class="i0">From her knees; and her feet to the earth seemed rooted; and one after one</p>
			<p class="i0">Her handmaidens all drew back, and with him was she left alone.</p>
			<p class="i1">So these twain stood⁠—all stirless and wordless stood face to face:</p>
			<p class="i0">As oaks they seemed, or as pines upsoaring in stately grace,</p>
			<p class="i0">Which side by side all still mid the mountains rooted stand</p>
			<p class="i0">When winds are hushed; but by breath of the breeze when at last they are fanned,</p>
			<p class="i0">Stir they with multitudinous murmur and sigh⁠—so they</p>
			<p class="i0">By love’s breath stirred were to pour out all in their hearts that lay.</p>
			<p class="i1">Then Aison’s son beheld how the maiden’s soul was adread</p>
			<p class="i0">With wilderment heaven-sent, and kindly-courteous he said:</p>
			<p class="i1">“Wherefore, O maiden, dost fear me so sorely, alone as I am?</p>
			<p class="i0">Never was I as the loud-tongued blusterers, void of shame,</p>
			<p class="i0">No, not when aforetime I dwelt in my fatherland oversea:</p>
			<p class="i0">Wherefore be thou not, maiden, over-abashed before me,</p>
			<p class="i0">That thou shouldst not inquire whatsoever thou wilt, or utter thy mind.</p>
			<p class="i0">But, seeing we twain be met with friendly hearts and kind</p>
			<p class="i0">In a place where sin is of heaven accurst, in a hallowed spot,</p>
			<p class="i0">Speak thou, and question withal as thou wilt: but beguile me not</p>
			<p class="i0">With pleasant words, forasmuch as thou gavest thy promise erewhile</p>
			<p class="i0">To thy sister, to give me the charm that I long for, the herbs of guile.</p>
			<p class="i0">I beseech thee in Hekatê’s name⁠—for the sake of thy parents I pray,</p>
			<p class="i0">And of Zeus, that o’er stranger and suppliant stretcheth his hand alway!</p>
			<p class="i0">Lo, a suppliant am I, a stranger withal, which am come to thee here,</p>
			<p class="i0">In sore straits bending the knee; for in this my task of fear</p>
			<p class="i0">Shall I nowise prevail, except I be holpen of thine and thee.</p>
			<p class="i0">And to thee will I render requital of thanks in the days to be⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">As is meet and right for them in a far-away land which dwell⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Making glorious thy name and thy fame, and mine hero-companions shall tell</p>
			<p class="i0">The story of thy renown, when to Hellas again they have won;</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, and the heroes’ wives and mothers, who now make moan</p>
			<p class="i0">For us, I ween, on the strand as they sit by the sighing brine:</p>
			<p class="i0">And to scatter in air their bitter affliction is thine⁠—is thine!</p>
			<p class="i0">Not I were the first⁠—was Theseus not saved from the ordeal grim</p>
			<p class="i0">By Minos’ child for her kindness’ sake which she bare unto him,</p>
			<p class="i0">Ariadne, born of the Sun-god’s daughter Pasiphaê?</p>
			<p class="i0">But she, when slumbered the wrath of Minos, over the sea</p>
			<p class="i0">Sailed with the hero, forsaking her land. The Immortals divine</p>
			<p class="i0">Loved well that maid: in the midst of the firmament set is her sign,</p>
			<p class="i0">A crown of stars, which they name Ariadne’s diadem,</p>
			<p class="i0">All night circling amidst of the signs that the heavens begem.</p>
			<p class="i0">Thou also shalt have of the Gods like thanks, if thou shalt redeem</p>
			<p class="i0">From destruction so goodly a host of heroes⁠—ah, needs must it seem</p>
			<p class="i0">That through form so lovely as thine should the beauty of kindness beam!”</p>
			<p class="i1">Extolling her so spake he; and her eyelids drooped, while played</p>
			<p class="i0">A nectar-smile on her lips; and melted the heart of the maid</p>
			<p class="i0">By his praising uplifted: her eyes are a moment upraised to his eyes,</p>
			<p class="i0">And all speech faileth: no word at the first to her lips may rise;</p>
			<p class="i0">But in one breath yearned she to speak forth all her joy and her pain.</p>
			<p class="i0">And with hand ungrudging forth from her odorous zone hath she ta’en</p>
			<p class="i0">The charm, and he straightway received it into his hands full fain.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, now would she even have drawn forth all her soul from her breast,</p>
			<p class="i0">And had laid it with joy in his hands for her gift, had he made request,</p>
			<p class="i0">So wondrously now from the golden head of Aison’s son</p>
			<p class="i0">Did Love out-lighten the witchery-flame; and her sweet eyes shone</p>
			<p class="i0">With the gleam that he stole therefrom, and her heart glowed through and through</p>
			<p class="i0">Melting for rapture away, from the lips of the rose as the dew</p>
			<p class="i0">At the sun’s kiss melteth away, when the dayspring is kindled anew.</p>
			<p class="i0">And these twain now on the earth were fixing their eyes abashed,</p>
			<p class="i0">And anon yet again their glances each on the other they flashed,</p>
			<p class="i0">As with radiant eyelids they smiled a heart-beguiling smile:</p>
			<p class="i0">And bespake him the maiden at last, yet scarce after all this while:</p>
			<p class="i1">“Give thou heed now, that my counsel may haply be for thine aid.</p>
			<p class="i0">What time at thy coming my father within thine hands shall have laid</p>
			<p class="i0">The crop of the serpent’s jaws for thy sowing, the teeth of bane,</p>
			<p class="i0">Then shalt thou watch for the hour when the night is sundered in twain.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then thou, when first in the river’s tireless flow thou hast bathed,</p>
			<p class="i0">Alone, with none other beside thee, in night-hued vesture swathed,</p>
			<p class="i0">Shalt dig thee a rounded pit, and over the dark earth-bowl</p>
			<p class="i0">Shalt thou slaughter a ewe, and shalt burn the unsevered carcase whole</p>
			<p class="i0">On a pyre, the which on the very brink of the pit thou hast piled,</p>
			<p class="i0">And propitiate only-begotten Hekatê, Perseus’ child,</p>
			<p class="i0">Out of a chalice pouring the hive-stored toil of the bee.</p>
			<p class="i0">So when thou hast sought the grace of the Goddess heedfully,</p>
			<p class="i0">Then turn thee to pass from the pyre, and beware lest any sound</p>
			<p class="i0">Or of footfalls behind thee startle thee, so that thou turn thee round,</p>
			<p class="i0">Or of baying of hounds, lest all that is wrought be undone thereby,</p>
			<p class="i0">And thyself to thine hero-companions never again draw nigh.</p>
			<p class="i0">And in water at dawn shalt thou steep this herb, and thy limbs shalt thou bare,</p>
			<p class="i0">And even as with oil shalt anoint thee therewith; and prowess there</p>
			<p class="i0">Shalt thou find, and strength exceeding great: thou wouldst nowise say</p>
			<p class="i0">That with men thou couldst match thee in might, but with Gods that abide for aye.</p>
			<p class="i0">Therewithal be thy lance and thy buckler besprent with the magic dew,</p>
			<p class="i0">And thy sword: then shall not the spear-heads prevail to pierce thee through</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the Earth-born men, nor the fiery breath of the bulls of bane</p>
			<p class="i0">Unendurably darting. Yet no long time shalt thou thus remain,</p>
			<p class="i0">But only for that same day: notwithstanding flinch not thou</p>
			<p class="i0">From the toil; and another thing yet for thine help will I tell to thee now:</p>
			<p class="i0">So soon as the mighty bulls thou hast yoked, and by manifold toil</p>
			<p class="i0">And by strength of thine hands hast sped the share through the stubborn soil,</p>
			<p class="i0">And adown the furrows the bristling harvest of giants shall stand,</p>
			<p class="i0">Where fell on the dusky clods the serpent’s teeth from thine hand,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even as thou mark’st them in throngs through the fallows upbursting to day,</p>
			<p class="i0">Cast thou in their midst unawares a massy stone: and they,</p>
			<p class="i0">As ravening hounds o’er a gobbet of flesh that wrangle, shall slay</p>
			<p class="i0">Each one his fellow: thou also in battle-fury shalt fall</p>
			<p class="i0">On the rout. So the Golden Fleece unto Hellas, if this be all,</p>
			<p class="i0">From Aia afar shalt thou bear:⁠—O yea, turn thou and depart</p>
			<p class="i0">Whithersoever it pleaseth thee: seek the desire of thine heart!”</p>
			<p class="i1">She spake, and her eyes to the earth at her feet in silence she cast;</p>
			<p class="i0">And her cheeks divinely fair were wet as her tears fell fast,</p>
			<p class="i0">As she sorrowed because that far and afar from her side o’er the main</p>
			<p class="i0">He must wander away. And she looked in his eyes, and she spake yet again</p>
			<p class="i0">With mournful word, and his right hand now hath she ta’en in her own;</p>
			<p class="i0">For the shamefastness now from her eyes on the wings of love had flown:</p>
			<p class="i1">“But O remember, if ever thou com’st to thine home afar,</p>
			<p class="i0">Medea’s name: and in like wise I, when sundered we are,</p>
			<p class="i0">Will forget thee not. But tell, of thy good will, where is thine home,</p>
			<p class="i0">Whitherward bound thou wilt fare in thy galley over the foam.</p>
			<p class="i0">Is it unto Orchomenus’ wealthy burg that thy feet shall go?</p>
			<p class="i0">Or anigh to Aiaia’s isle? Of the maiden fain would I know,</p>
			<p class="i0">Some maiden far-renowned, whom thou namedst the daughter, I wis,</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Pasiphaê: kinswoman unto my sire that lady is.”</p>
			<p class="i1">So did she speak; and over him stole, as the maiden wept,</p>
			<p class="i0">Love the victorious; and answering speech to his lips hath leapt:</p>
			<p class="i1">“Yea, verily, never by night, I ween, and by day nevermore</p>
			<p class="i0">Shalt thou be forgotten of me, if unto Achaia’s shore</p>
			<p class="i0">Unscathed I shall ’scape indeed, and Aiêtes before me set,</p>
			<p class="i0">For mine hands to achieve, none other toil more desperate yet.</p>
			<p class="i0">But if this hath pleased thee, to learn what land I call mine own,</p>
			<p class="i0">I will tell thee⁠—yea, and mine own heart biddeth me make it known</p>
			<p class="i0">A country there is⁠—steep mountain-ramparts around it run⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">A land of streams and of pastures, wherein Iapetus’ son,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even Prometheus, begat the valiant Deukalion,</p>
			<p class="i0">Who of all men was first that builded a city, or reared a fane</p>
			<p class="i0">To the Deathless, and first was he of the kings over men that reign.</p>
			<p class="i0">That land do the folk that around it dwell Haimonia call.</p>
			<p class="i0">Therein is my city Iolkos found: therein withal</p>
			<p class="i0">Stand many beside, where not so much have they heard as the name</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Aiaia’s isle: but rumour hath told how Minyas came</p>
			<p class="i0">Thereout, even Minyas Aiolus’ son, and builded the town</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Orchomenus; over the marches Kadmeian her towers look down.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet why should I speak things vain as the wild winds’ empty sound</p>
			<p class="i0">Of our home, of the daughter of Minos, the princess far-renowned</p>
			<p class="i0">Ariadne⁠—the glorious name whereby that heart’s desire</p>
			<p class="i0">Was called among men, the maiden of whom thou dost inquire?</p>
			<p class="i0">Would God that, even as Minos his heart unto Theseus inclined</p>
			<p class="i0">For her sake, so would thy father with me be in friendship joined!”</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake he, with tender words and caressing the maiden to woo.</p>
			<p class="i0">But anguish exceeding bitter was thrilling the heart of her through:</p>
			<p class="i0">And in sorrow of spirit with vehement words she made reply:</p>
			<p class="i1">“O haply in Hellas ’tis good to be heedful of friendship’s tie:</p>
			<p class="i0">But Aiêtes is not such a man among men as thou saidst but now</p>
			<p class="i0">Was Minos, Pasiphaê’s lord; and with Ariadne, I trow,</p>
			<p class="i0">May I nowise compare me: wherefore of guest-love speak not thou.</p>
			<p class="i0">Only remember thou me, when safe thou hast sped thy flight</p>
			<p class="i0">To Iolkos; and I will remember⁠—yea, in my parents’ despite</p>
			<p class="i0">Will remember thee: and from far may a rumour come unto me,</p>
			<p class="i0">Or a messenger-bird with the tidings, when I am forgotten of thee!</p>
			<p class="i0">Or me, even me, may the swift-winged blasts from the earth’s breast tear,</p>
			<p class="i0">And away hence over the sea to the land of Iolkos bear,</p>
			<p class="i0">That so I might cast reproaches on thee, yea, unto thy face,</p>
			<p class="i0">And remind thee that all by mine help thou escapedst⁠—but oh that my place</p>
			<p class="i0">That day were of right in thine halls, the place of a queen at the board!”</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake she, and down her cheeks the piteous tears aye poured.</p>
			<p class="i0">But he caught up her words even there, and with comforting speech did he say:</p>
			<p class="i1">“O stricken one, leave thou the empty blasts at their will to stray,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the messenger-bird to roam, for thy words are but vanity!</p>
			<p class="i0">But if ever thou come unto those abodes, if Hellas thou see,</p>
			<p class="i0">Honour and worship of men and of women then shall be thine;</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, they shall reverence thee as a very presence divine,</p>
			<p class="i0">Because that again to their homes did the sons of the Hellenes win</p>
			<p class="i0">By thy devising, yea, and the brethren of these, and their kin;</p>
			<p class="i0">And many a stalwart husband of thee hath received his life.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then shalt thou enter the bridal bower with me⁠—my wife;</p>
			<p class="i0">And nothing shall come between our love, and nothing shall sunder,</p>
			<p class="i0">Till death’s shroud fold us around, and our hearts are chilled thereunder.”</p>
			<p class="i1">He spake, and to hear him her soul was melted within her then:</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet she shuddered to see the deeds whose end was beyond her ken.</p>
			<p class="i0">Ah hapless!⁠—not long was she doomed to refuse a home in the land</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Hellas, for hereunto was she guided of Hêrê’s hand,</p>
			<p class="i0">To the end that for Pelias’ bane Aiaian Medea might come</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto Iolkos the hallowed, forsaking her fatherland-home.</p>
			<p class="i1">But by this from afar were the handmaids glancing towards these twain</p>
			<p class="i0">Full oft in disquiet; for need was now, as the day ’gan wane,</p>
			<p class="i0">That the maiden unto her mother should turn her homeward again.</p>
			<p class="i0">But she thought not yet of departing, such joy did her spirit take</p>
			<p class="i0">Alike in his goodlihead, and the winsome words that he spake.</p>
			<p class="i0">But Aison’s son took heed, and late and at last did he say:</p>
			<p class="i1">“Lo now, it is time to depart, lest the sun’s light fade away</p>
			<p class="i0">Before we be ware, and lest some stranger should haply espy</p>
			<p class="i0">All this. Yet again will we meet, coming hitherward, thou and I.”</p>
			<p class="i1">So in sweetest communion did these try each the other’s heart</p>
			<p class="i0">Thus far; and thereafter they sundered. And now did Jason depart</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto his friends and the ship, while his heart for joy beat high;</p>
			<p class="i0">And she to her handmaids, and all in a troop did these draw nigh</p>
			<p class="i0">To meet her: she marked them not, as unto her side they drew;</p>
			<p class="i0">For her soul to the clouds had soared far up ’twixt earth and the blue.</p>
			<p class="i0">And with feet that moved in a dream she mounted the fleet-running wain:</p>
			<p class="i0">In her left hand grasped she the reins, in her right the whip hath she ta’en</p>
			<p class="i0">Curious-fashioned, to drive the mules; and fast did they flee,</p>
			<p class="i0">As on to the city they sped and the palace; and Chalkiopê</p>
			<p class="i0">’Gan ask her of all that befell, for her sons’ sake anguish-stirred;</p>
			<p class="i0">But rapt in a trance of thoughts back-drifting she heard not a word,</p>
			<p class="i0">And to all that eager questioning never a word she said:</p>
			<p class="i0">But adown on a lowly stool did she sit at the foot of the bed,</p>
			<p class="i0">On her left hand propping her cheek as she wearily drooped aside;</p>
			<p class="i0">And with tears were her eyes brimming over, as surged the dark chill tide</p>
			<p class="i0">Of remembrance of emprise dread that the covenant bound her to bide.</p>
			<p class="i1">Now when Aison’s son had wended aback to the place where stayed</p>
			<p class="i0">His comrades, what time he had left them in faring to meet the maid.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then, telling them all the story the while, with these did he hie</p>
			<p class="i0">To the throng of the heroes; and now to the galley drew they anigh.</p>
			<p class="i0">And they saw him, and lovingly greeted, and asked him of all that befell:</p>
			<p class="i0">And he in the midst of them all did the maiden’s counsels tell;</p>
			<p class="i0">And he showed them the dread spell-drug. One only of all sat apart,</p>
			<p class="i0">Idas, nursing his wrath: but the others with joyful heart</p>
			<p class="i0">Turned them, when darkness fell, their hands from their labour to stay,</p>
			<p class="i0">And in great peace laid them down to their rest: but with dawning day</p>
			<p class="i0">To Aiêtes, to ask for the seed of the serpent, sent they away</p>
			<p class="i0">Two men; and foremost Telamon Arês-beloved they sent,</p>
			<p class="i0">And Aithalides, glorious scion of Hermes, beside him went.</p>
			<p class="i0">So went they, and not for nought, for to these at their coming were given</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Aiêtes the king the teeth for the grim strife hard to be striven,</p>
			<p class="i0">The teeth of the dragon Aonian, that, seeking the wide world through</p>
			<p class="i0">For Europa, Kadmus found in Ogygian Thêbê, and slew,</p>
			<p class="i0">The monster that lurked, a warder, beside the Aretian spring.</p>
			<p class="i0">There also he dwelt, by the heifer led, which Apollo the king</p>
			<p class="i0">By the word of prophecy gave for his guide, that he should not stray.</p>
			<p class="i0">These teeth did Tritonis the Goddess tear from its jawbone away,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the gift on Aiêtes and him that had slain the beast she bestowed.</p>
			<p class="i0">On the plain Aonian Kadmus the teeth of the serpent sowed;</p>
			<p class="i0">And an earth-born nation was founded there of Agênor’s son,</p>
			<p class="i0">The remnant left when the harvest of Arês’ spear was done.</p>
			<p class="i0">So the teeth to bear to the galley Aiêtes gave full fain,</p>
			<p class="i0">For he weened that to win to the goal of his task he should strive in vain,</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, though to the yoking of those dread bulls he should haply attain.</p>
			<p class="i1">And the sun down under the dark earth far away in the west,</p>
			<p class="i0">Beyond the uttermost hills of the Aethiops, sank to his rest;</p>
			<p class="i0">And the Night was laying her yoke on the necks of her steeds. Then spread</p>
			<p class="i0">On the shore by the hawsers of Argo the heroes each his bed.</p>
			<p class="i0">But Jason, so soon as the flashing stars of the circling Bear</p>
			<p class="i0">Had set, and under the firmament hushed was all the air,</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto the wilderness even as a thief all stealthily hied</p>
			<p class="i0">With whatso was needful; for all had he taken thought to provide</p>
			<p class="i0">In the day: and fared with him Argus, and milk from the flock he bore,</p>
			<p class="i0">And a ewe therewithal; for these had he ta’en from the galley’s store.</p>
			<p class="i0">But when he beheld the place, which was far aloof from the tread</p>
			<p class="i0">Of men, where under the unscreened sky the clear meads spread,</p>
			<p class="i0">There first of all in the flow of the sacred river he bathed</p>
			<p class="i0">His limbs full reverently, and all his body he swathed</p>
			<p class="i0">In a dark-hued cloak, which Hypsipylê, daughter of Lemnos’ race,</p>
			<p class="i0">Gave him aforetime, memorial of many a loving embrace.</p>
			<p class="i0">Thereafter he digged him a pit in the plain of a cubit wide,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the billets he heaped, and the lamb’s throat cut by the dark pit’s side.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the carcase he stretched on the pile, and he thrust thereunder the fire</p>
			<p class="i0">And kindled the brands, and mingled libations he poured on the pyre,</p>
			<p class="i0">Calling on Hekatê Brimo to draw for his helper nigh.</p>
			<p class="i1">And when he had called on her, backward he fared, and she hearkened his cry.</p>
			<p class="i0">Out of nethermost caverns of darkness the Awful Queen drew near</p>
			<p class="i0">To the Aisonid’s sacrifice, and about her did shapes of fear,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even serpents, in horrible wreaths and knots, mid the oak-boughs hang:</p>
			<p class="i0">And flashed a fitful splendour of torches unnumbered; and rang</p>
			<p class="i0">Around her wild and high the baying of hounds of hell.</p>
			<p class="i0">And all the meadow-land trembled under her tread; and the yell</p>
			<p class="i0">Pealed of the marish-haunting Nymphs of the river, that dance</p>
			<p class="i0">In the pastures wherethrough Amaryntian Phasis’ ripples glance.</p>
			<p class="i0">And terror gat hold upon Aison’s son; but, for all his dread,</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet he turned him not round as his feet thence bore him, until he had sped</p>
			<p class="i0">Back to his friends: and by this over Caucasus’ snow-flecked height,</p>
			<p class="i0">As she rose, was the Dawn mist-cradled shooting her shafts of light.</p>
			<p class="i1">And now did Aiêtes array in the corslet of stubborn mould</p>
			<p class="i0">His breast, the corslet that Arês gave, in the day when rolled</p>
			<p class="i0">Mimas of Phlegra beneath his hands in the dust of doom.</p>
			<p class="i0">And he set on his head the golden helmet of fourfold plume</p>
			<p class="i0">Flaming like to the world-encompassing sun’s red gleam,</p>
			<p class="i0">When first in the dawning he leapeth up from the Ocean-stream.</p>
			<p class="i0">He uplifted his manifold-plated shield, and he grasped in his hand</p>
			<p class="i0">His terrible spear and resistless: was none that before it might stand</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the rest of the heroes, since Herakles now they had left afar:</p>
			<p class="i0">He only against it had matched his might in the shock of war.</p>
			<p class="i0">And his fair-fashioned chariot of fleet-footed steeds was stayed for the king</p>
			<p class="i0">By Phaethon hard by; then to the chariot-floor did he spring;</p>
			<p class="i0">And he drew through his fingers the reins, and forth of the city-gate</p>
			<p class="i0">Drove he along the broad highway, by the lists of fate</p>
			<p class="i0">To stand; and a countless multitude hastened forth at his side.</p>
			<p class="i0">And as when to the Isthmian athlete-strife Poseidon doth ride</p>
			<p class="i0">High-borne on his car, or Tainarus-wards, or to Lerna’s mere,</p>
			<p class="i0">Or Hyantian Onchestus, the temple-grove that the nations revere;</p>
			<p class="i0">And as when to Kalaurea oft-times his chariot-wheels have rolled,</p>
			<p class="i0">And Haimonia’s rock, and Geraistus’ town that the forests enfold,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even so was Aiêtes, lord of the Kolchian folk, to behold.</p>
			<p class="i1">But Jason the while, obeying the rede from Medea that came,</p>
			<p class="i0">In water hath steeped that drug; and he sprinkled his shield with the same,</p>
			<p class="i0">And his sturdy spear and his sword; and his comrades with might and main</p>
			<p class="i0">Made proof of his harness, thronging around: yet essayed they in vain</p>
			<p class="i0">To bend that spear, though it were but a little; but evermore</p>
			<p class="i0">Unyielding and stark it abode in their strong hands, even as before.</p>
			<p class="i0">But Idas, Aphareus’ son⁠—for with wrath was the heart of him black⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">With his great sword hewed at the shaft by the butt; but the blade leapt back</p>
			<p class="i0">As hammer from anvil, jarred by the shock; and a mighty shout</p>
			<p class="i0">From the heroes rejoicing in hope of the trial’s end rang out.</p>
			<p class="i0">Thereafter his own limbs Jason sprinkled; and lo, he was filled</p>
			<p class="i0">With terrible prowess, unspeakable, aweless; the hands of him thrilled</p>
			<p class="i0">Tingling with strength, as waxed their sinews with gathering might.</p>
			<p class="i0">And even as when a battle-steed afire for the fight</p>
			<p class="i0">Leapeth and neigheth and paweth the ground, and glorying rears</p>
			<p class="i0">His neck like a stormy-crested billow, and pricketh his ears,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even so in the pride of his prowess triumphant was Aison’s son,</p>
			<p class="i0">And hither and thither on high he bounded now and anon,</p>
			<p class="i0">In his hands uptossing his brazen shield and his spear’s tough ash.</p>
			<p class="i0">Thou hadst said that adown through the murky welkin the leaping flash</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the tempest-levin was gleaming and flickering once and again</p>
			<p class="i0">From the clouds that are bringing hard after their burden of blackest rain.</p>
			<p class="i0">Nor long time now would they tarry from faring forth to essay</p>
			<p class="i0">The emprise, but row after row upon Argo’s thwarts sat they,</p>
			<p class="i0">And onward exceeding swiftly to Arês’ plain they sped.</p>
			<p class="i0">Overagainst the city so far before them it spread</p>
			<p class="i0">As the space from the start to the turning-post that the car must win</p>
			<p class="i0">What time, when a king unto Hades hath passed, his princely kin</p>
			<p class="i0">For hero and horse ordain the strife of the funeral game.</p>
			<p class="i0">There found they Aiêtes, and other the tribes of the Kolchian name,</p>
			<p class="i0">The folk on the cliffs Caucasian in lines far-stretching arrayed,</p>
			<p class="i0">While the king by the winding brink of the river their coming stayed.</p>
			<p class="i1">And Aison’s son, when his comrades had made the hawsers fast,</p>
			<p class="i0">Then with his spear and his shield to the mighty trial passed,</p>
			<p class="i0">Bounding from Argo forth; and there was he bearing with him</p>
			<p class="i0">His gleaming helm with the dragon’s sharp teeth filled to the brim,</p>
			<p class="i0">With his brand on his shoulders slung, bare-limbed, and in some wise seeming</p>
			<p class="i0">As Arês, in some wise Apollo the lord of the sword gold-gleaming.</p>
			<p class="i0">O’er the fallow he glanced, and the brazen yoke of the bulls he espied.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the plough, hewn solid of massy adamant, therebeside.</p>
			<p class="i0">So he strode thereunto, and beside it his strong spear planted upright</p>
			<p class="i0">On the butt-spike thereof, and leaning against it the morion he pight.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then tracing the countless tracks of the bulls right on did he fare</p>
			<p class="i0">With nought but his shield: but suddenly forth from an unseen lair,</p>
			<p class="i0">From a den in the bowels of the earth, wherein was their grimly stall,</p>
			<p class="i0">Whereover the lurid-gleaming smoke ever hung as a pall,</p>
			<p class="i0">Forth rushed they together as one, outbreathing the splendour of flame;</p>
			<p class="i0">And the heroes quaked when they saw. But Jason, as onward they came,</p>
			<p class="i0">Set wide his feet; and even as a rock in the sea doth abide</p>
			<p class="i0">The charging surges whereon the scourging storm-blasts ride,</p>
			<p class="i0">Before him he held to withstand them his shield; and the terrible twain</p>
			<p class="i0">Their strong horns bellowing dashed against it with might and main:</p>
			<p class="i0">Nevertheless by their onset they stirred him never a jot.</p>
			<p class="i0">And even as when the armourers’ bellows of stout hide wrought</p>
			<p class="i0">In the piercèd melting-pot anon with murmur and sigh</p>
			<p class="i0">Kindle the ravening flame, and anon doth the breath of them die;</p>
			<p class="i0">And an awful roar goeth up therefrom as the flames leap higher</p>
			<p class="i0">From beneath, even so these twain outbreathing the rushing fire</p>
			<p class="i0">Roared from their mouths, and about him as lightning leapt and played</p>
			<p class="i0">The devouring blaze: yet warded him ever the spells of the maid.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then grasped he the tip of the horn of the right-hand monster, and so</p>
			<p class="i0">Mightily haled with his uttermost strength, till he bowed it low</p>
			<p class="i0">To the brazen yoke, and, striking its hoof of brass with his foot,</p>
			<p class="i0">Suddenly cast it adown on its knees, and its fellow brute,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even as it charged him, with one thrust down on its knees did he throw.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then his broad shield cast he away on the ground, and, to and fro</p>
			<p class="i0">To this side and that side striding, he kept them fall’n in their place</p>
			<p class="i0">On their fore-knees, swiftly moving athwart the fervent blaze,</p>
			<p class="i0">While marvelled the king at the hero’s might. Then drew nigh two,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even Tyndareus’ sons⁠—for that thus long since had he bidden them do;⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">And they lifted and gave him the yoke on the necks of the bulls to be bound:</p>
			<p class="i0">And deftly thereon did he bind it, and ’twixt them upraised from the ground</p>
			<p class="i0">The brazen pole, and he made it fast by its pointed tip</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto the yoke: and they twain back from the fire to the ship</p>
			<p class="i0">Withdrew. Then he caught up again, and cast on his shoulders his shield</p>
			<p class="i0">Behind him; the helmet strong with the serpent’s sharp teeth filled</p>
			<p class="i0">He grasped, and his spear resistless, wherewith, as a ploughman wight</p>
			<p class="i0">Pricketh his oxen with goad Pelasgian, so did he smite</p>
			<p class="i0">The flanks of the monsters, and starkly and steadily still did he hold</p>
			<p class="i0">Unswerving the plough-heft cunningly fashioned of adamant mould.</p>
			<p class="i0">But the bulls were raging the while with fury exceeding sore</p>
			<p class="i0">Outbreathing the ravening splendour of fire: as that mad roar</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the buffeting winds was the blast of their breath, when the seafarers quail</p>
			<p class="i0">At their yelling above all else, and furl the straining sail.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet it was not long ere the beasts, as the stern spear bade them to toil,</p>
			<p class="i0">Moved on, and behind them was broken the fallow’s rugged soil</p>
			<p class="i0">Cloven apart by the might of the bulls and the ploughman strong.</p>
			<p class="i0">And terribly crashed and groaned, the ploughshare’s furrows along,</p>
			<p class="i0">The clods uprent, of a man’s load each, and with sturdy stride</p>
			<p class="i0">Trampling the path the hero followed, and aye flung wide</p>
			<p class="i0">The teeth of the serpent over the clods upheaved by the share,</p>
			<p class="i0">Ever heedfully turning his head, lest haply, or e’er he was ware,</p>
			<p class="i0">The harvest fell of the Earth-born against him should rise: and with strain</p>
			<p class="i0">Of brazen hoofs on laboured the while that fearsome twain.</p>
			<p class="i0">And it was so, that when the third part now was left of the day,</p>
			<p class="i0">From the dawn as it waned, when the toil-forwearied labourers pray</p>
			<p class="i0">“O come to us, sweet unyoking-tide! O tarry thou not!”</p>
			<p class="i0">Even then by the stalwart ploughman the fallowfield’s earing was wrought,</p>
			<p class="i0">For all it was ploughgates four; and the bulls from the yoke loosed he,</p>
			<p class="i0">And with shouting and smiting he scared them over the plain to flee.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then back toward Argo he hied him again, while yet all clear</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the Earth-born brood the furrows he saw; and with cheer on cheer</p>
			<p class="i0">His comrades hailed him and heartened. He plunged the brazen gleam</p>
			<p class="i0">Of his helm mid the river’s waters, and slaked his thirst from the stream.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then bent he his knees till supple they grew; and he filled with might</p>
			<p class="i0">His great heart, battle-aflame as a boar, when he whetteth for fight</p>
			<p class="i0">Against the hunters his tushes, and drippeth the plenteous froth</p>
			<p class="i0">Down from his jaws to the ground, as he churneth their foam in his wrath.</p>
			<p class="i0">Now by this was the harvest of Earth-born men over all that field</p>
			<p class="i0">Upspringing; and all round bristled with thronging shield on shield</p>
			<p class="i0">And with battle-spears twy-pointed, and morions glorious-gleaming</p>
			<p class="i0">The garth of the death-dealing War-god: the splendour thereof upstreaming</p>
			<p class="i0">Through the welkin lightened, and up to the heaven of heavens did it go.</p>
			<p class="i0">And as when on the face of the earth hath fallen abundant snow,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the wind-blasts chase the wintry clouds in scattered rout</p>
			<p class="i0">Under the mirk of the night, and all the hosts shine out</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the stars through the darkness glittering; so those Earth-born men</p>
			<p class="i0">Flashed, o’er the face of the ground upgrowing: but Jason then</p>
			<p class="i0">Remembered the rede that Medea the cunning-hearted spake;</p>
			<p class="i0">And a huge round boulder up from the earth in his grasp did he take⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">A terrible quoit for Arês the War-god: there should not be found</p>
			<p class="i0">Four stalwart men of strength to upraise it a span from the ground.</p>
			<p class="i0">This caught he up in his hand, and afar with a leap did he throw</p>
			<p class="i0">Into their midst, and behind his buckler himself crouched low</p>
			<p class="i0">Awelessly. Loudly the Kolchians shouted⁠—it rang as the roar</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the shouting sea when his surges over the sharp reefs pour.</p>
			<p class="i0">But speechless amazement seized on Aiêtes at that vast sweep</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the massy crag: and the Earth-born as fleetfoot hounds ’gan leap</p>
			<p class="i0">Each on his fellow, and yelling they slew: the embattled lines</p>
			<p class="i0">On their mother the earth, by their own spears slain, were falling, as pines</p>
			<p class="i0">Or as oaks which the down-rushing blasts of the tempest have scourged and riven.</p>
			<p class="i0">And even as leapeth a fiery star from the depths of the heaven,</p>
			<p class="i0">Trailing behind him a splendour, a marvel to men which mark</p>
			<p class="i0">How he darteth in shattering glories athwart the firmament’s dark,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even so seemed Aison’s son on the Earth-born rushing: he bare</p>
			<p class="i0">His sword from the scabbard outflashed; and here he smote them and there,</p>
			<p class="i0">Mowing them down: full many on belly or flank did he smite</p>
			<p class="i0">Which had won to the air waist-high, and some which had risen to light</p>
			<p class="i0">But shoulder-high, and some as they stood but now upright,</p>
			<p class="i0">And other some, even as their feet ’gan strain in the onset of fight.</p>
			<p class="i0">And like as, when round the marches the war upstarteth from sleep,</p>
			<p class="i0">A husbandman, fearing lest foemen the toil of his hands may reap,</p>
			<p class="i0">Graspeth a curvèd sickle newly-whetted in hand,</p>
			<p class="i0">And moweth in haste the crop yet green, neither letteth it stand</p>
			<p class="i0">Until it be parched in the season due by the shafts of the sun;</p>
			<p class="i0">Even so of the Earth-born the harvest he reaped; and with blood did they run,</p>
			<p class="i0">Those furrows, as hurrying runnels that brim from a fountain’s plashing.</p>
			<p class="i0">Fast fell they, some on their faces, bowing their knees, and gnashing</p>
			<p class="i0">Their teeth on the rough clods⁠—this one stayed on his palm, and he</p>
			<p class="i0">On his side: as they wallowed they seemed as the monster-brood of the sea.</p>
			<p class="i0">And many, or ever their feet from beneath the earth had come,</p>
			<p class="i0">Pierced through, from the height whereunto they had risen, even therefrom</p>
			<p class="i0">Down-drooping, were resting their death-dewed brows on the earth again.</p>
			<p class="i0">Even so, I ween, when Zeus down-poureth the measureless rain,</p>
			<p class="i0">Droop orchard-shoots new-planted, till low on the earth they lie,</p>
			<p class="i0">Snapped hard by the roots, that the gardener’s toil is doubled thereby,</p>
			<p class="i0">And there come on the heart of the lord of the vineyard, which planted the same,</p>
			<p class="i0">Confusion of face and deadly anguish in such wise came</p>
			<p class="i0">On Aiêtes the king vexation of spirit and heaviness.</p>
			<p class="i0">And back to the city he wended amidst of the Kolchian press,</p>
			<p class="i0">Dark-plotting to bring the heroes’ purpose with speed to nought.</p>
			<p class="i1">And the daylight died, and Jason’s mighty achievement was wrought.</p>
