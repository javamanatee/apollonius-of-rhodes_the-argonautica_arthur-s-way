			<h3 id="book2">THE SECOND BOOK</h3>
			<p class="i0"><span class="sc">There</span> were there steadings of cattle, and Amykus’ farms were there,</p>
			<p class="i0">Proud king of Bebrykian men, whom erst a wood-nymph bare;</p>
			<p class="i0">For Bithynian Meliê couched with Poseidon the Lord of Birth.</p>
			<p class="i0">Overweening was this their son above all the children of Earth,</p>
			<p class="i0">Who even on wayfaring strangers his tyrannous ordinance laid</p>
			<p class="i0">That they should not depart from his land till that trial of prowess were made</p>
			<p class="i0">Against him with the fist: and neighbours full many he smote that they died.</p>
			<p class="i0">And now to the galley he came; but he scorned in the height of his pride</p>
			<p class="i0">To inquire of them wherefore they voyaged, or ask what men were they:</p>
			<p class="i0">But with sudden defiance he challenged them all, and thus did he say:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Sea-rovers, hearken the thing that is meet and right ye should know.</p>
			<p class="i0">This is the ordinance⁠—none may depart, from my country to go,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even none who hath come to Bebrykia’s folk out of alien lands,</p>
			<p class="i0">Or ever against mine hands he hath lifted in battle his hands.</p>
			<p class="i0">Choose for you therefore the mightiest man of all your array,</p>
			<p class="i0">And set ye him here for the strife of the fist against me this day.</p>
			<p class="i0">But and if ye shall shrink from the trial, and trample my laws underfoot,</p>
			<p class="i0">Verily mighty constraint shall pursue you with bitter pursuit.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake he in pride overweening, and came upon them as they heard</p>
			<p class="i0">Fierce anger, but most by his threatening vaunt Polydeukes was stirred.</p>
			<p class="i0">Straightway he stood for his fellows’ champion forth, and he cried:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Peace!⁠—threaten not us, whatsoever the name that hath puffed thee with pride,</p>
			<p class="i0">With brutal mishandling:⁠—yea, unto these thy laws will we bow.</p>
			<p class="i0">Even I right willingly offer me⁠—lo, I will meet thee now.’</p>
			<p class="i1">Roundly he spake; and with rolling eyes glared on him the king</p>
			<p class="i0">As a lion javelin-smitten, when out on the mountains the ring</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the hunters hemmeth him round; but, albeit encompassed about</p>
			<p class="i0">By the throng, he heedeth them not, but his glance ever searcheth him out,</p>
			<p class="i0">Him only, which wounded him first, yet quelled him not with the stroke.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then Tyndareus’ son laid by his goodly-woven cloak</p>
			<p class="i0">Of delicate threads, a gift of remembrance for sweet days past</p>
			<p class="i0">Of a daughter of Lemnos. His mantle’s dark folds Amykus cast,</p>
			<p class="i0">With the clasps thereof, to the ground, and the shepherd’s staff that he bore,</p>
			<p class="i0">The rugged olive his hand from the windy hill-slope tore.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then looked they, and chose for the combat a spot that was good in their sight;</p>
			<p class="i0">And all their companions they bade sit down to left and to right.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then stood they forth, nor in form nor in stature alike to behold:</p>
			<p class="i0">But the one might be seed of Typhôeus the fell, or a monster of old,</p>
			<p class="i0">Ay, even as one of the giant brood of Earth, which she bare</p>
			<p class="i0">To wreak upon Zeus her wrath: but Tyndareus’ son showed fair</p>
			<p class="i0">As the star of the heaven, whose loveliest beams through the fading blue</p>
			<p class="i0">Shine in the eventide, when the wings of the night drop dew.</p>
			<p class="i0">Even such was the child of Zeus, and the soft down bloomed on his chin,</p>
			<p class="i0">And bright were his dancing eyes: but waxed his breast within</p>
			<p class="i0">His fury and might like a wild beast’s rage; and he struck out fast</p>
			<p class="i0">With his hands, making trial if swift were their play, as in days overpast,</p>
			<p class="i0">Uncramped by the stress of toil and the strain of the weary oar.</p>
			<p class="i0">But Amykus proved not his limbs, but he glared on his foe evermore</p>
			<p class="i0">Standing in silence aloof, and he yearned in eager mood</p>
			<p class="i0">To smite and bespatter the hero’s breast with the spurting blood.</p>
			<p class="i0">And between them Lykôreus, Amykus’ henchman, cast on the ground</p>
			<p class="i0">In front of their feet the fighting-gauntlets with thongs overbound,</p>
			<p class="i0">Strips of the raw hide, dry, all ridged with wrinkles were they.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then unto the hero the giant with arrogant words ’gan say:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Whichsoever thou wilt, lo, freely and willingly grant I to thee,</p>
			<p class="i0">Without casting of lots, that thou mayst not hereafter murmur at me.</p>
			<p class="i0">Now bind them about thine hands: thou shalt learn, and to others shall tell</p>
			<p class="i0">How featly I carve the tough bull-hides, how passing well</p>
			<p class="i0">I wield them withal, to bedabble with blood the jaws of men.’</p>
			<p class="i1">He spake, but the hero scorned with wrangling to answer again:</p>
			<p class="i0">And he made no ado, but the pair lying nighest his feet, the same</p>
			<p class="i0">Lightly smiling he took. Then unto him Kastor came,</p>
			<p class="i0">And Talaus the mighty, the scion of Bias: they bound on his wrists</p>
			<p class="i0">The gauntlets in haste, oft bidding him play the man in the lists.</p>
			<p class="i0">And to Amykus Ornytus came and Arêtus; but naught knew they⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Fools!⁠—that they girded a doomed man then for his latest fray.</p>
			<p class="i1">So when they were ready, and forth in the lists stood face to face,</p>
			<p class="i0">Straightway in front of their bodies their brawny hands did they raise.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then closed they, and matched their might in the grim play furiously.</p>
			<p class="i0">And now the Bebrykian king, as a charging wave of the sea</p>
			<p class="i0">With storm-roughened crest overarcheth a ship, and would surely o’erwhelm,</p>
			<p class="i0">But that scantly she ’scapeth by wisdom of him that swayeth the helm,</p>
			<p class="i0">When over her bulwark to hurl itself mad is the surge of the wave;</p>
			<p class="i0">So followed he hard upon Tyndareus’ son to daunt him: he gave</p>
			<p class="i0">No respite. The hero by cunning keeping him scatheless aye</p>
			<p class="i0">Baffled his every rush: well marked he his brutal play,</p>
			<p class="i0">To wot if the giant in might were haply resistless, or no.</p>
			<p class="i0">So ever he faced him and warded, and flashed back blow for blow.</p>
			<p class="i0">And even as when the shipwrights with hammers mightily swinging</p>
			<p class="i0">Smite on the beams of a galley, driving the clamps close-clinging</p>
			<p class="i0">Sharply together, that bang upon clang cometh crashing and ringing,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the air is a-shiver; so crack ’neath the buffets the cheeks of the twain,</p>
			<p class="i0">So crash their jaws, and so clatter their teeth as the swift blows rain.</p>
			<p class="i0">Nor flinch they nor falter, but facing each other smite they amain,</p>
			<p class="i0">Till spent are they both, and for laboured panting they needs must refrain.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then standing apart for a little they wiped from their foreheads away</p>
			<p class="i0">The streaming sweat, while their deep chests heaved with the toil of the fray.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then each against other again they rushed, as when on the lea</p>
			<p class="i0">Two bulls for a heifer are fighting in fury of rivalry.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then mid their battle did Amykus up to his full height spring</p>
			<p class="i0">Like an ox-slayer straining a-tiptoe⁠—downward the weight did he swing</p>
			<p class="i0">Of his gauntleted hand on the hero; but swerving swift from the stroke</p>
			<p class="i0">By a turn of his head hath he foiled him, hath caught on his shoulder and broke</p>
			<p class="i0">Its force⁠—he hath slipped past the knee of the giant his knee⁠—he hath rushed</p>
			<p class="i0">With his whole weight dashing his fist ’neath his ear, and the bones hath he crushed,</p>
			<p class="i0">That for agony down on his knees he sank, and the Minyans’ shout</p>
			<p class="i0">Rang; and with one great gasp was the giant’s life poured out.</p>
			<p class="i1">Uprose the Bebrykian men to avenge the wild king’s fall:</p>
			<p class="i0">And full upon Polydeukes as one man rushed they all</p>
			<p class="i0">With rugged clubs and with javelins tossing in furious hands.</p>
			<p class="i0">But his comrades afront of him closed, and they drew their keen-whetted brands</p>
			<p class="i0">Out of their scabbards: and Kastor the first with the sword-sweep cleft</p>
			<p class="i0">The head of a foe, as against him he rushed; and to right and to left</p>
			<p class="i0">Upon either shoulder aslant did the ghastly halves of it fall.</p>
			<p class="i0">Polydeukes o’erthrew the giant Itymoneus, Mimas withal;</p>
			<p class="i0">For, weaponless, one with a sudden leap did he spurn on the breast</p>
			<p class="i0">With his foot, and in dust he fell; and one, as to conflict he pressed,</p>
			<p class="i0">Over the left brow smote he with swift right hand, and he tare</p>
			<p class="i0">The eyelid away, that it left the wretch’s eyeball bare.</p>
			<p class="i0">And Oreides, Amykus’ henchman, a brawny champion,</p>
			<p class="i0">Stabbed with his lance at the flank of Talaus, Bias’ son;</p>
			<p class="i0">Howbeit he slew him not, but sliding along the skin</p>
			<p class="i0">The brass sped under his belt, neither tasted the flesh within.</p>
			<p class="i0">And Arêtus at Iphitus smote with a club of the knotted oak,</p>
			<p class="i0">That Eurytus’ scion, the battle-bider, reeled from the stroke.</p>
			<p class="i0">Howbeit not yet was the hero doomed unto deadly bane;</p>
			<p class="i0">Nay, soon was the smiter’s self by Klytius’ sword to be slain.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then did Ankaius the dauntless son of Lykurgus in haste</p>
			<p class="i0">Swing up his mighty axe, and around his left arm cast</p>
			<p class="i0">The bear’s dark fell for a shield, and amidst the Bebrykian array</p>
			<p class="i0">In fury of onset he plunged, and beside him charged to the fray</p>
			<p class="i0">Aiakus’ sons, and Jason the valiant leapt to the fight.</p>
			<p class="i0">And as when mid the folds the grey wolves scare in huddled affright</p>
			<p class="i0">Vast throngs of sheep on a wintry day, having rushed on the pen</p>
			<p class="i0">By the keen-nosed dogs unscented, unmarked of the shepherd’s ken;</p>
			<p class="i0">And in fury they seek to leap the fence, and to seize the prey,</p>
			<p class="i0">Glaring and glaring, a fierce-eyed ring; and, shrinking away</p>
			<p class="i0">Upon every side, on each other trample the sheep; even so</p>
			<p class="i0">Drave they in ghastly rout the haughty Bebrykian foe.</p>
			<p class="i0">And as when bee-keepers or shepherds fill with the stifling smoke</p>
			<p class="i0">The cleft of a rock where dwell the honey-fashioning folk,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the bees for a while all thronging within their cavern-home,</p>
			<p class="i0">Murmur with muffled hum, till, driven at last therefrom</p>
			<p class="i0">By the murky fume, they pour from the crag, and they flee away;</p>
			<p class="i0">Even so not long they abode, but scattered in disarray</p>
			<p class="i0">Through Bebrykia bearing the tidings of Amykus’ doom did they fly.</p>
			<p class="i0">Fools!⁠—nothing they knew of another woe even then drawn nigh</p>
			<p class="i0">All unforeseen, for their orchards were wasted in that same hour,</p>
			<p class="i0">And amidst of their hamlets did Lykus’ ravening spears devour,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the Mariandynians slew, forasmuch as their king was afar,</p>
			<p class="i0">For that aye for the iron-bearing land were the nations at war.</p>
			<p class="i0">So now had the spoilers fallen on garth and byre and fold;</p>
			<p class="i0">While seaward the heroes headed their sheep in throngs untold,</p>
			<p class="i0">And this one to that one cried the while they drave the prey:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Bethink ye, what price had they paid for their felon folly to-day,</p>
			<p class="i0">If haply a God had but brought our Herakles hither to aid!</p>
			<p class="i0">Ha! surely had he but been here, no trial, I ween, had been made</p>
			<p class="i0">Of strife with the fists; but so soon as the caitiff drew nigh to proclaim</p>
			<p class="i0">His ordinance, straightway the club should have made him forget the same,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even as he spake it, yea, and forget the might of his hand.</p>
			<p class="i0">Ah, but we left him, we left him, alone on a desolate strand,</p>
			<p class="i0">And we sailed away oversea:⁠—full soon shall we know, each one,</p>
			<p class="i0">Our baneful folly, seeing our mightiest champion is gone!’</p>
			<p class="i1">But the counsels of Zeus had wrought all this, beyond their ken.</p>
			<p class="i0">So here through the night they abode, and the hurts of the wounded men</p>
			<p class="i0">They tended, and slew to the Gods everlasting the sacrifice;</p>
			<p class="i0">And a mighty supper they dight: fell sleep upon no man’s eyes,</p>
			<p class="i0">By the bowl as they sat and the blazing altar the long night through,</p>
			<p class="i0">With their golden locks enwreathed with the leaves of a bay that grew</p>
			<p class="i0">Hard by the strand, about whose stem was their hawser bound.</p>
			<p class="i0">And to Orpheus’ lyre they chanted; their voices’ blended sound</p>
			<p class="i0">Rang tunefully: all the breathless beach lay tranced with the spell</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the song; for of Zeus of Therapnae’s child did the sweet hymn tell.</p>
			<p class="i1">Over the dusky hills did the light of the new sun leap,</p>
			<p class="i0">As he rose from his far sea-bourn, as he roused the shepherds from sleep.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then from the stem of the bay did the heroes their hawser uncoil,</p>
			<p class="i0">And they laid in the galley so much as sufficed for their need of the spoil;</p>
			<p class="i0">And before the breeze up swirling Bosporus’ flood they steered.</p>
			<p class="i0">There steep and high the surge, as a mountain’s crown upreared</p>
			<p class="i0">Afront of the prow, rusheth on them as leapeth a beast on the prey⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Higher, still higher upheaved to the clouds: thou wouldst verily say,</p>
			<p class="i0">‘They cannot escape grim doom, for that full o’er the galley’s side</p>
			<p class="i0">Swingeth its madding crest like a cloud!’ Yet a bark may ride</p>
			<p class="i0">Safe even o’er such, if she have but a helmsman good at need.</p>
			<p class="i0">And by Tiphys’ steering-craft even so did the heroes speed</p>
			<p class="i0">Through the peril unscathed, yet sore dismayed. So the wild day passed,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the night; and with dawn on Bithynia’s shore the anchor they cast.</p>
			<p class="i1">There hard by the sea had Phineus Agênor’s son his abode,</p>
			<p class="i0">Who endured above all men trouble and anguish, a baleful load.</p>
			<p class="i0">For a spirit of prophecy Lêto’s son had bestowed of old</p>
			<p class="i0">On him; yet he thrust all reverence aside, and to mortals foretold</p>
			<p class="i0">The sacred purpose of Zeus, the mind of Heaven’s King.</p>
			<p class="i0">Therefore did Zeus requite him with eld long-lingering;</p>
			<p class="i0">And he took from his eyes the pleasant light, and he suffered him not</p>
			<p class="i0">To have joy of the meats untold which the dwellers around aye brought,</p>
			<p class="i0">What time to his halls they resorted the purpose of heaven to hear.</p>
			<p class="i0">But out of their caverns of cloud ever suddenly swooping anear</p>
			<p class="i0">The Harpies would snatch them away from his lips and his hands evermore</p>
			<p class="i0">With their talons, and whiles was there left unto him of all that store</p>
			<p class="i0">No whit, and whiles but a crumb, that for torment his life might be spared.</p>
			<p class="i0">And they poured over all a loathly stench: was none that dared,</p>
			<p class="i0">I say not, to carry thereof to his mouth, but even to stand</p>
			<p class="i0">Far off, so foully the remnants reeked of the banquet banned.</p>
			<p class="i0">But now, on his ears as their voices and tramp of their coming brake,</p>
			<p class="i0">He knew that the men were at hand whereof Zeus’ oracle spake</p>
			<p class="i0">That their coming should bring for him respite, in peace to eat his bread.</p>
			<p class="i0">And he rose from his couch, as a shadowy dream might rise from a bed,</p>
			<p class="i0">Bowed over his staff, and with wrinkled feet ’gan creep to the door</p>
			<p class="i0">Groping along the walls; and for helplessness trembled sore</p>
			<p class="i0">And for age his limbs as he moved, and with filth was his parchèd skin</p>
			<p class="i0">All leprous, and nought save this enwrapped the bones within.</p>
			<p class="i0">So forth of the hall he came, and he bowed on the threshold-stone</p>
			<p class="i0">His weary knees; and a swoon, like a dark pall over him thrown,</p>
			<p class="i0">Enshrouded him; under his feet him seemed that the earth reeled round;</p>
			<p class="i0">And he lay in a strengthless trance, and his lips could frame no sound.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the heroes beheld him, and round about in a throng they pressed</p>
			<p class="i0">And marvelled; until at the last the man from the depth of his breast</p>
			<p class="i0">Drew laboured and difficult breath, and uttered his prophecy:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Hearken, ye noblest of Hellas’ sons, if ye verily be</p>
			<p class="i0">The self-same heroes that Jason leadeth forth on the Quest</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the Golden Fleece in Argo the ship at a King’s grim hest.</p>
			<p class="i0">Of a surety ye be: my soul hath knowledge of everything</p>
			<p class="i0">By her divination yet. Thanks therefore to thee, O King,</p>
			<p class="i0">O Son of Lêto, I render from depths of affliction and woe!</p>
			<p class="i0">O friends, by the Suppliants’ Zeus, who is ever the sternest foe</p>
			<p class="i0">Of transgressors⁠—for Phœbus’ sake, and in awful Hêrê’s name</p>
			<p class="i0">I beseech⁠—by the Gods I implore you in whose care hither ye came,</p>
			<p class="i0">Help me: deliver from anguish a most ill-fated man,</p>
			<p class="i0">Neither hasten away uncaring and leave me in bale and ban,</p>
			<p class="i0">As ye find me: for not on mine eyes alone hath the fierce foot trode</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the Vengeance-fiend, and I drag to the end eld’s weary load;</p>
			<p class="i0">But a curse more bitter than all still hangeth over mine head,</p>
			<p class="i0">For the Harpies are wont evermore to snatch from my lips my bread,</p>
			<p class="i0">Swooping adown from a den of destruction, a viewless lair.</p>
			<p class="i0">Neither find I any device for mine help: nay, easier it were</p>
			<p class="i0">To escape the ken of mine own heart’s thoughts when I crave to be fed,</p>
			<p class="i0">Than theirs; so swift through the welkin on hovering wings are they sped.</p>
			<p class="i0">But if haply ever they leave but a morsel of meat on my board,</p>
			<p class="i0">It reeketh with most unendurable strength of a stench abhorred.</p>
			<p class="i0">No man, no, not for an instant, might dare draw nigh to the same,</p>
			<p class="i0">Not though in his breast were a heart forged all of adamant frame.</p>
			<p class="i0">But me of a surety doth hard compelling of hunger constrain</p>
			<p class="i0">To abide, and abiding to stay this famine’s gnawing pain.</p>
			<p class="i0">But those my tormentors, an oracle saith, shall be made to flee</p>
			<p class="i0">By Boreas’ sons; neither strangers shall my deliverers be,</p>
			<p class="i0">If indeed I be Phineus, renowned among men in the days long gone</p>
			<p class="i0">For my wealth and my soothsaying lore, if Agênor called me son,</p>
			<p class="i0">If the sister of these, Kleopatra, when over the Thracians I reigned,</p>
			<p class="i0">Came to mine halls, a bride by a royal bride-price gained.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So ended Agênor’s son, and compassion’s o’ermastering pain</p>
			<p class="i0">Thrilled all the heroes, but chiefly the North-wind’s scions twain.</p>
			<p class="i0">Brushing the tears from their eyes they drew nigh him, and Zethes spake;</p>
			<p class="i0">And the hand of the grief-worn sire in his hand with the word did he take:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘O hapless, none other is more afflicted than thou, I trow,</p>
			<p class="i0">Among men!⁠—ah, wherefore on thee is there heaped such a burden of woe?</p>
			<p class="i0">Baleful in sooth was the folly wherewith through thy prophecy-lore</p>
			<p class="i0">Against Gods thou transgressedst: for this was their anger exceeding sore.</p>
			<p class="i0">Howbeit our spirit within us, although we be fain, is afraid</p>
			<p class="i0">To help thee, if on us indeed a God this honour hath laid.</p>
			<p class="i0">For to dwellers on Earth the rebukes of Immortals be plain to discern;</p>
			<p class="i0">And we dare not chase yon Harpies from thee, howsoever we yearn</p>
			<p class="i0">For thine help, in the hour of their coming, except thou swear to us first</p>
			<p class="i0">That for this we shall lose not the high Gods’ favour, as men accurst.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake he: the stricken in years uplifted and opened wide</p>
			<p class="i0">His sightless eyes straightway, and with swift words Phineus replied:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Hush!⁠—thrust not such thoughts, my son, on a spirit affliction-filled!</p>
			<p class="i0">Be witness Latona’s son, who taught to me gracious-willed</p>
			<p class="i0">Prophecy-lore; and be witness this mine ill-starred doom,</p>
			<p class="i0">And this dark cloud on mine eyes, and the Gods of the Underworld Gloom⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">May their curse, if I die with a lie on my tongue, be upon me for aye!⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">That on you no wrath of the Gods shall descend for your help this day.’</p>
			<p class="i1">Then by the oath were they kindled to help him, and fled their fears.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the young men straightway made ready the meat for the stricken in years⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">The last ordained for the Harpies’ spoil⁠—and anigh to him stood</p>
			<p class="i0">Those twain, to smite with the sword those fiends when they swooped on the food.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then first his hands on the meats did he lay, that grey-haired sire:⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">But sudden as bitter blasts, or as flashes of levin-fire,</p>
			<p class="i0">Unawares from the clouds they had darted, and swooping adown they yelled</p>
			<p class="i0">Their awful scream, fierce-eager for prey; but the heroes beheld,</p>
			<p class="i0">And shouted amidst of their onrush. The fiends at the challenge of war</p>
			<p class="i0">Swift ravined the meats from the boards, and over the sea afar</p>
			<p class="i0">Soared they away, but there did their foul sick stench remain.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then straightway hard on their track did the North-wind’s scions twain</p>
			<p class="i0">Uplifting their swords follow after them fast, for with tireless might</p>
			<p class="i0">Zeus filled them: howbeit they had not prevailed to follow their flight</p>
			<p class="i0">But with Zeus’s help, for that faster than Zephyrus’ blasts they darted</p>
			<p class="i0">Evermore, when on Phineus they swooped, and whene’er from the wretch they departed.</p>
			<p class="i0">And as when on the mountain-ridges keen hounds cunning in chase</p>
			<p class="i0">On the track of the hornèd goats or the deer hard-following race</p>
			<p class="i0">Swiftly, and ever a little behind the prey as they strain,</p>
			<p class="i0">Snap at the haunch of the quarry, and clash their teeth in vain;</p>
			<p class="i0">So Zetes and Kalaïs rushed ever nearer with eager grip,</p>
			<p class="i0">Clutched at them, smote at them, missed but by sword-point or finger-tip.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, even despite Heaven’s will had they rent them limb from limb,</p>
			<p class="i0">Overtaking them far away where the Floating Islands swim⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">But Iris the Storm-foot beheld them, and downward she plunged from the sky</p>
			<p class="i0">Through a whirlwind of air, and with words of restraining aloud did she cry:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Sons of the North-wind, forefended it is that ye smite with the sword</p>
			<p class="i0">The Harpies, great Zeus’s hounds; but myself will pronounce the word</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the oath that shall hold them from lighting again on the ancient’s board.’</p>
			<p class="i1">Then spake she the words of the Oath of the Styx, the oath most dread</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto all the Gods, whose reverence guardeth the words once said,</p>
			<p class="i0">That the Harpies should never thereafter draw nigh unto Phineus’ hall,</p>
			<p class="i0">To the home of Agênor’s son, for so was it doomed to befall.</p>
			<p class="i0">To the oath then yielded the heroes, and backward they turned their flight</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto the ship; and the Strophads, the Isles of Return, were they hight</p>
			<p class="i0">Therefrom, which of old the Floating Isles had been called of men.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the Harpies and Iris parted, and into their cavern-den</p>
			<p class="i0">In Krêtê, the land of Minos, they plunged: but Olympus-ward</p>
			<p class="i0">Uplifted ’twixt heaven and earth on her swift wings Iris soared.</p>
			<p class="i1">But the heroes bathed and anointed the skin all fouled and sere</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the ancient the while; and the choice of the fatlings they slew for their cheer,</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the flock which they bare away of the spoil of Amykus dead.</p>
			<p class="i0">So when in the halls a plenteous eventide-feast they had spread,</p>
			<p class="i0">They feasted; and Phineus amidst them was like unto them that dream,</p>
			<p class="i0">As from ravenous hunger he cheered his heart, so strange did it seem.</p>
			<p class="i0">So there, when with meats and with wine they had satisfied all their need,</p>
			<p class="i0">Through the long night kept they vigil, and waited for Boreas’ seed.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the ancient sat in their midst in the ruddy glow of the fire;</p>
			<p class="i0">And he told of their voyaging’s bourn, and the end of their desire:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Give ear unto me:⁠—forefended it is that ye hear all through</p>
			<p class="i0">Your fate:⁠—whatsoe’er seemeth good to the Gods I will hide not from you.</p>
			<p class="i0">Mad was I of yore, when I spake unto Earth’s sons Zeus’s will</p>
			<p class="i0">In all points unto the end: for this is his pleasure still</p>
			<p class="i0">To reveal unto men his oracles short of the fulness of doom,</p>
			<p class="i0">That so they may lean on the Gods, and faith and prayer have room.</p>
			<p class="i1">The Rocks Kyanean first, when that gotten ye are from me,</p>
			<p class="i0">In the place where the two seas meet, the Dark Blue Crags, shall ye see.</p>
			<p class="i0">Through that dread pass no pilot, I ween, hath prevailed to go;</p>
			<p class="i0">For rooted they are not to earth on foundations of rock therebelow;</p>
			<p class="i0">But with rush and recoil unceasingly each against other they clash:</p>
			<p class="i0">High over them archeth the crested brine, and the foam-feathers flash</p>
			<p class="i0">From the seething cauldron: the precipice-foreland thundereth aye.</p>
			<p class="i0">Wherefore to this my counsel give good heed, and obey,</p>
			<p class="i0">If indeed with prudent soul and with fear of the Gods on high</p>
			<p class="i0">Ye essay this Quest, that by doom self-sought ye may not die</p>
			<p class="i0">As the fool, nor in rashness of youth essay to rush thereby.</p>
			<p class="i0">First with a bird, with a white-winged dove, shall ye make assay,</p>
			<p class="i0">Speeding her flight from the ship’s prow. If she shall win her way</p>
			<p class="i0">Safe ’twixt the Crags of Terror, and out to the open sea,</p>
			<p class="i0">No longer thereafter from daring the selfsame path shrink ye;</p>
			<p class="i0">But grip ye the oars in your hands, and put forth your uttermost might</p>
			<p class="i0">Cleaving the gorge of the sea, for that safety’s deliverance-light</p>
			<p class="i0">Shall not be in prayer so much as the strength of your hands and the strain.</p>
			<p class="i0">Wherefore let all else be, and toil ye with might and main</p>
			<p class="i0">Boldly: but ere then pray as ye list; I say not nay.</p>
			<p class="i0">But and if the death-trap clutch in the midst the dove, and slay,</p>
			<p class="i0">Then sail ye aback; for better by far it is that ye</p>
			<p class="i0">Should yield to the Deathless. The evil fate should ye nowise flee</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the Rocks⁠—no, not though fashioned of iron your Argo should be.</p>
			<p class="i0">O wretches, dare not to transgress the warning my tongue hath given,</p>
			<p class="i0">Though thrice so much ye account me abhorred of the Dwellers in Heaven⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, though it were more than thrice⁠—as I am by my grievous sin,</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet dare not to flout the omen, to thrust your galley therein!</p>
			<p class="i0">And these things shall fall as they haply shall fall. But if scatheless ye shun</p>
			<p class="i0">The rush of the Clashing Rocks, and the Pontus Sea shall be won,</p>
			<p class="i0">Sailing therefrom, the Bithynians’ land to your right shall ye keep,</p>
			<p class="i0">Ever heedfully standing out from the reefs, until ye shall sweep</p>
			<p class="i0">Round the outfall of swift-flowing Rheba, and round the headland dark,</p>
			<p class="i0">And within the haven of Thynê’s isle shall anchor your bark.</p>
			<p class="i0">Thence turn ye aback for a little space o’er the long sea-swell,</p>
			<p class="i0">Till ye beach your keel on the strand where the Mariandynians dwell.</p>
			<p class="i0">Thereby is a path through darkness descending to Hades’ hall,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the Cape Acherusian towereth upward, a giant wall.</p>
			<p class="i0">And swirling Acheron cleaving the mountain’s heart unseen</p>
			<p class="i0">Suddenly poureth forth his flood from a mighty ravine.</p>
			<p class="i0">Thereby many column-hills of the Paphlagonian shore</p>
			<p class="i0">Shall ye pass, the nation whose king was in Enetê born of yore,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even Pelops; and yet do they boast them sprung from his princely line.</p>
			<p class="i0">And a headland there is, looking full where the circling Bear doth shine,</p>
			<p class="i0">A crag exceeding steep, and Karambis it hath to name.</p>
			<p class="i0">The blasts of the North-wind are sundered about the crest of the same,</p>
			<p class="i0">So sheer doth it spring from the sea, so sharply it cleaveth the air.</p>
			<p class="i0">Now when ye have rounded the same, lo, stretcheth before you there</p>
			<p class="i0">A great beach: far at the end of the gleaming strand’s long sweep</p>
			<p class="i0">’Neath a jutting foreland the waters of Halys seaward leap</p>
			<p class="i0">Terribly roaring; and hard thereby doth Iris go,</p>
			<p class="i0">A lesser river, whose swirls soft-rippling gently flow.</p>
			<p class="i0">And onward from thence is the bend of a huge cape towering high</p>
			<p class="i0">Up from the land, and the mouth of the river Thermodon thereby,</p>
			<p class="i0">Where the height Themiskyrian watcheth the sleeping bay at its side,</p>
			<p class="i0">Cometh murmuring still of her journeyings over the mainland wide.</p>
			<p class="i0">There is the plain of Doias, the cities three rise near</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the Amazon Maids: then they whose lot is of all most drear,</p>
			<p class="i0">The Chalybes, dwell in a rugged land on a stubborn soil,</p>
			<p class="i0">Smithying-craftsmen; in forging of iron ever they toil.</p>
			<p class="i0">And anigh to them dwell Tibarenians, lords of many sheep,</p>
			<p class="i0">Past Zeus the Defender of Strangers, the fane upon Genetê’s steep.</p>
			<p class="i0">And next unto these, on their marches, the Mossynœcians dwell</p>
			<p class="i0">In a land of forests, in many a mountain-cradled dell,</p>
			<p class="i0">Whose homes be in towers of timber, fashioned and carven well.</p>
			<p class="i0">But coast past these, and beach your keel on a smooth isle: there</p>
			<p class="i0">Beat back with your uttermost cunning the ravening scourge of the air,</p>
			<p class="i0">Those birds, which in countless multitudes haunt, men say, the strand</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the desolate isle;⁠—therein doth a temple of Arês stand</p>
			<p class="i0">Of stone, which was built by the queens of the Amazon war-array,</p>
			<p class="i0">Otrêrê and Antiopê, what time they marched to the fray;⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">For there shall a help for your need from the bitter sea arise</p>
			<p class="i0">Unlooked-for: wherefore, abide there, with kindly intent I advise.</p>
			<p class="i0">But now what do I, transgressing again?⁠—what need that I</p>
			<p class="i0">Should tell to you every whit of the tale of my prophecy?</p>
			<p class="i0">Onward away from the isle, on the mainland shore’s far side,</p>
			<p class="i0">The Philyrans dwell, and beyond the Philyran folk abide</p>
			<p class="i0">The Makrônes, and next, the Becheirian tribes, a host untold.</p>
			<p class="i0">Next after these the Sapeirians’ land shall your eyes behold.</p>
			<p class="i0">Next these the Bezyrans, their neighbours, dwell; and beyond, at last,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even the warrior Kolchians: yet shall ye speed on past</p>
			<p class="i0">Your galley, till stayed at the uttermost bourn of the sea ye are.</p>
			<p class="i0">There over the mainland Kytaian, from Amaranth mountains afar,</p>
			<p class="i0">And over the plain Kirkaian rolling evermore,</p>
			<p class="i0">His broad flood into the sea doth eddying Phasis pour.</p>
			<p class="i0">Into the selfsame river’s mouth your galley bring:</p>
			<p class="i0">Then on the towers shall ye look of Kytaian Aiêtes the king,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the War-god’s grove dim-shadowed. And high on a dark oak-tree</p>
			<p class="i0">Hangeth the Fleece; and a dragon, a monster fearful to see,</p>
			<p class="i0">Ever glareth around, keeping watch and ward: never dawn doth arise,</p>
			<p class="i0">Neither darkness descendeth, when sweet sleep quelleth his ruthless eyes.’</p>
			<p class="i1">Even so did he speak: straightway as they heard were they thrilled with fear.</p>
			<p class="i0">Long speechless they sat, till brake at the last that silence drear</p>
			<p class="i0">Aison’s son, sore wildered that boding of evil to hear:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘O ancient, now hast thou come to the bourn of the toils we must know</p>
			<p class="i0">On the sea, and hast told us the token, by trust wherein we may go</p>
			<p class="i0">Through the baleful rocks, and win unto Pontus: but if once more,</p>
			<p class="i0">If through these we escape, we shall homeward return unto Hellas’ shore,</p>
			<p class="i0">Exceeding fain were I this also to learn of thee.</p>
			<p class="i0">How shall I do?⁠—how track such a measureless path o’er the sea,</p>
			<p class="i0">Who am but a youth, and with youths?⁠—and behold, this Kolchian land</p>
			<p class="i0">At the ends of the earth doth lie, on the great sea’s uttermost strand.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So did he cry; but answered the ancient, and spake yet again:</p>
			<p class="i0">‘My son, when once thou hast safely fled through the Rocks of Bane,</p>
			<p class="i0">Fear not, for a God shall show thee another voyaging-track</p>
			<p class="i0">From Aia: yea, after Aia guides shalt thou nowise lack.</p>
			<p class="i0">But, friends, of the guileful aid of the Cyprian Queen take thought;</p>
			<p class="i0">For of her unto glorious issues shall all your toils be wrought.</p>
			<p class="i0">And now of the things yet lying beyond these ask me nought.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So answered Agênor’s son; and lo, those twain stood nigh,</p>
			<p class="i0">The sons of the Thracian North-wind, swooping adown from the sky.</p>
			<p class="i0">On the threshold their swift feet set they; and straight from his carven chair</p>
			<p class="i0">Each hero upsprang, beholding the champions suddenly there.</p>
			<p class="i0">Eager for tidings were they; and Zetes, still as he drew</p>
			<p class="i0">Hard breath from the toil of the hunting, told them how far they flew</p>
			<p class="i0">Chasing them, told how Iris restrained them at point to slay;</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the oaths which the Goddess gave of her grace; how in sore dismay</p>
			<p class="i0">’Neath Dictê’s cliff in a cavern vast they had plunged out of sight.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then were the heroes all in the mansion filled with delight</p>
			<p class="i0">For the tidings, and Phineus withal. Then spake unto him straightway</p>
			<p class="i0">Aison’s son, and with love overflowing his soul ’gan say:⁠—</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Of a surety a God, O Phineus, there was, in compassion that bent</p>
			<p class="i0">To look on thy grievous affliction, and us from afar he sent</p>
			<p class="i0">Hither, that Boreas’ sons might drive thy tormentors from thee.</p>
			<p class="i0">Now if he would give but light to thine eyes, such gladness in me</p>
			<p class="i0">Would stir, as though with the Fleece I were come to mine home, I trow.’</p>
			<p class="i1">He spake, but the head of the ancient sank, and he answered low:</p>
			<p class="i0">‘Nay, Aison’s son, it is past recall: no dawn shall arise</p>
			<p class="i0">Balm-breathing on them, for blasted are these my sightless eyes.</p>
			<p class="i0">Nay, death let a God bestow right speedily, rather than this:</p>
			<p class="i0">Then, when I am dead, shall I enter at last into perfect bliss.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake they, and each unto other the answering speech returned.</p>
			<p class="i0">And amidst of their converse in no long space the dawn-flush burned</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the Child of the Mist: then gathered the neighbours to Phineus’ door</p>
			<p class="i0">Which in time past day by day wont thither to come evermore;</p>
			<p class="i0">And, despite the curse, from their own a portion of meat each brought.</p>
			<p class="i0">And to all did the ancient⁠—yea, to the poor whose hands bare nought⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Speak kindly his oracles; yea, from afflictions many he freed</p>
			<p class="i0">By his soothsaying: wherefore they came, and they ministered unto his need.</p>
			<p class="i0">And came with the rest Paraibius, he that was dearest of all</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto him, and with joy was he ware of the presences thronging the hall.</p>
			<p class="i0">For the ancient to him long since had foretold that a chieftain-band,</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto Aiêtes’ city faring from Hellas-land,</p>
			<p class="i0">On the beach of the Thynian coast should make their hawsers fast,</p>
			<p class="i0">And by these should the Harpies of Zeus be restrained from tormenting at last.</p>
			<p class="i0">So with words of wisdom and love the ancient gladdened each heart</p>
			<p class="i0">Ere he let them go; but Paraibius suffered he not to depart,</p>
			<p class="i0">But bade him abide with the chieftains, and sent him, making request</p>
			<p class="i0">Of his friend to go to the flock, and to bring the goodliest</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the sheep unto him. So when to perform his behest he had sped,</p>
			<p class="i0">To the chieftains gathered there spake Phineus, and lovingly said:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘O friends, not every man is overweening of mood,</p>
			<p class="i0">Neither forgetful of kindness; so loyal of heart and so good</p>
			<p class="i0">Is yon man. Hither he came on a day to inquire of his fate:</p>
			<p class="i0">For, when never so hard he toiled, sore labouring early and late,</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet ever his need grew greater, his poverty waxed alway,</p>
			<p class="i0">With leanness wasting his frame: day followed on evil day</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet worse: no respite there was to his weariful pain. But herein</p>
			<p class="i0">Was this man paying the debt of his father’s ancient sin.</p>
			<p class="i0">For once on the mountains alone the trees of the forest felling</p>
			<p class="i0">He had set at nought the prayers of a Nymph in an oak-tree dwelling.</p>
			<p class="i0">For with earnest entreaty she moaned her request, and besought him with tears</p>
			<p class="i0">To spare that trunk which had grown with her growth, wherewith through the years</p>
			<p class="i0">Of long generations her life was bound; but in folly and pride</p>
			<p class="i0">Of his youthful arrogance hewed he on: and the Tree-nymph died.</p>
			<p class="i0">Wherefore the Wood-maid caused that her death thereafter should be</p>
			<p class="i0">For a curse unto him and his children. And I, when he came unto me,</p>
			<p class="i0">Knew of the ancient sin; and an altar I bade him raise</p>
			<p class="i0">To the Thynian Nymph, and atonement-victims to give to the blaze,</p>
			<p class="i0">Praying to ’scape from the weird pronounced on his father of yore.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then, when from the doom of the Goddess deliverance came, never more</p>
			<p class="i0">Forgat he me, nor neglected: and sorely against his will</p>
			<p class="i0">From my doors do I send him fain to attend mine afflictions still.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake Agenor’s son; and straightway returned again</p>
			<p class="i0">His friend with fatlings twain from the flock. Rose Jason then</p>
			<p class="i0">And rose the North-wind’s sons at the ancient prophet’s word.</p>
			<p class="i0">Eftsoons called they on the name of Apollo the Prophecy-lord;</p>
			<p class="i0">Then slew they the sheep on the hearth as sloped the sun to the west.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the younger men of their band made ready the plenteous feast.</p>
			<p class="i0">So when they had eaten, they turned to their rest, as each man chose,</p>
			<p class="i0">By the hawsers of Argo these, through the mansion in clusters those.</p>
			<p class="i0">But at dawn the Etesian breezes blew, which o’er every land</p>
			<p class="i0">Equally blow in their season by Zeus’s high command.</p>
			<p class="i1">Kyrênê, ’tis told, in the meads where Peneios’ waters roll</p>
			<p class="i0">Pastured her sheep in the olden days; for dear to her soul</p>
			<p class="i0">Were her maidenhood and her couch unstained: but, even as she strayed</p>
			<p class="i0">By the stream with her flock, did Apollo snatch from the earth the maid</p>
			<p class="i0">From Haimonia afar, and mid Chthonian Nymphs did he set her down,</p>
			<p class="i0">Where over their Libyan haunts the steeps Myrtosian frown.</p>
			<p class="i0">There did she bear Aristaius, and Phœbus’ son did they call</p>
			<p class="i0">In Haimonia the Shepherd Lord, and the Mighty Hunter withal;</p>
			<p class="i0">For the God of his love to a Nymph transformed her, and made her there</p>
			<p class="i0">The Lady of the Land, long-lived: but his child he bare,</p>
			<p class="i0">A babbling infant yet, to be nurtured in Cheiron’s cave.</p>
			<p class="i0">And to him, when he grew unto manhood, a bride the Muses gave;</p>
			<p class="i0">And cunning in healing they taught him, with prophecy-wisdom they fed;</p>
			<p class="i0">And their tender of sheep did they make him, that all their flocks he led,</p>
			<p class="i0">In the plain Athamantian of Phthia that pastured, by Othrys’ side,</p>
			<p class="i0">And where the sacred streams of the river Apidanus glide.</p>
			<p class="i0">But when Sirius glared on the isles of Minos with scorching blaze,</p>
			<p class="i0">Neither came to the dwellers therein any respite for many days,</p>
			<p class="i0">For this Aristaius they sent, by the Archer-god’s command,</p>
			<p class="i0">To avert the plague; and he left at his father’s behest the land</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Phthia, and dwelt in Kos, and assembled thither the folk</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Parrhasia, even the people sprung from Lykaon’s stock.</p>
			<p class="i0">So to Rain-giver Zeus he builded a mighty altar there,</p>
			<p class="i0">And he offered sacrifice meet to the star of the fiery glare</p>
			<p class="i0">On the hills, and to Zeus himself the son of Kronos; and so</p>
			<p class="i0">O’er the earth from Zeus the cool Etesian winds yet blow</p>
			<p class="i0">For forty days: and, or ever the red Dog-star doth rise,</p>
			<p class="i0">The priests in Kos unto this day offer him sacrifice.</p>
			<p class="i1">So telleth the tale: and there were the heroes constrained to stay</p>
			<p class="i0">Land-bound by the selfsame winds. But the Thynians day by day,</p>
			<p class="i0">Of their love for Phineus, brought to them gifts of abundant cheer.</p>
			<p class="i0">And thereafter unto the Blessèd Twelve did the wanderers rear</p>
			<p class="i0">On the further strand an altar, and victims offered they there</p>
			<p class="i0">Ere they entered the sea-swift galley to row: yet forgat not to bear</p>
			<p class="i0">In Argo a trembling dove, but Euphêmus clutched her fast</p>
			<p class="i0">In his hand, as with terror she shrank and cowered; and so at the last</p>
			<p class="i0">Loose from the Thynian land the hawsers twain they cast.</p>
			<p class="i1">Yet not unmarked of Athênê onward again did they fare:</p>
			<p class="i0">Swiftly her feet hath she set on a cloud light-floating in air</p>
			<p class="i0">Which should waft her along, for she caused that the weight divine it bore.</p>
			<p class="i0">So seaward she swept to the help of the toilers at the oar.</p>
			<p class="i0">And as when one roveth afar from his own land⁠—oftentimes thus</p>
			<p class="i0">We men in our hardihood wander, and no land seemeth to us</p>
			<p class="i0">Too far away, but all paths lie within our ken⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">And he thinketh upon his home, and all in a moment then</p>
			<p class="i0">Him seemeth the track over sea and o’er land thereunto lieth plain,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the eyes of his soul in his eager pondering thitherward strain;</p>
			<p class="i0">Even so swiftly the Daughter of Zeus through the welkin hath sped,</p>
			<p class="i0">Till her feet on the perilous strand of the coast Bithynian tread.</p>
			<p class="i1">So when they were come to the narrow gorge of the winding strait</p>
			<p class="i0">Where to right and to left stern cliffs pent in that grim sea-gate,</p>
			<p class="i0">Then the swirling rush of the surf dashed, bursting up from below,</p>
			<p class="i0">O’er the ship as she went, and onward in sore dismay did they row.</p>
			<p class="i0">And now the thud of the rocks, as each against other they clashed,</p>
			<p class="i0">Ceaselessly smote on their ears, and thundered the cliffs brine-lashed.</p>
			<p class="i0">Even then Euphêmus uprose firm-grasping the dove in his hand,</p>
			<p class="i0">And on to the prow he strode, and the oarsmen obeyed the command</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Tiphys Hagnias’ son, that they rowed with might and main</p>
			<p class="i0">To drive the Argo betwixt the rocks through the perilous lane,</p>
			<p class="i0">Putting their trust in their strength; and the crags, as asunder they leapt,</p>
			<p class="i0">Opening they saw⁠—of all men last⁠—round a bend as they swept.</p>
			<p class="i0">And their spirit was melted within them:⁠—but now Euphêmus hath sped</p>
			<p class="i0">The flight of the wings of the dove: each man uplifted his head,</p>
			<p class="i0">Watching what now should befall:⁠—on, onward between them, on</p>
			<p class="i0">Flew she; but face to face those charging walls of stone</p>
			<p class="i0">Came rushing together, and crashed, and the seething brine uproared</p>
			<p class="i0">Vast-volumed like to a cloud; and the madding sea-gulf roared</p>
			<p class="i0">With an awful voice, and thundered the welkin wide all round.</p>
			<p class="i0">And out of the caverns under the rugged cliffs the sound</p>
			<p class="i0">Of a hollow rumbling came, as the sea surged inward; and high</p>
			<p class="i0">O’er the cliffs from the dashing waves did the spurts of the white foam fly.</p>
			<p class="i0">The ship broached-to in the wave-rush: shorn by the rocks was the tip</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the dove’s tail-feathers; but onward she flew, by the death-gin’s grip</p>
			<p class="i0">Unscathed. Loud shouted the oarsmen; and Tiphys cried to them then</p>
			<p class="i0">To row with their might, for the crags were parting asunder again.</p>
			<p class="i0">But for trembling they faltered in rowing, until the indraught caught</p>
			<p class="i0">The ship in the strength of its sweep back-swinging; and lo, they were brought</p>
			<p class="i0">Betwixt those rocks. Then fell upon all most ghastly dread,</p>
			<p class="i0">For destruction that none could escape was hanging above each head.</p>
			<p class="i0">Even now through the gap wide Pontus to right and to left was beheld:</p>
			<p class="i0">But all unawares at their bows a mighty surge upswelled</p>
			<p class="i0">Overbowed like a precipice-frown; and they saw as the green arch gleamed,</p>
			<p class="i0">And with cowering heads did they shut their eyes⁠—to their souls it seemed</p>
			<p class="i0">That down on the ship’s whole length it would leap, and overwhelm;</p>
			<p class="i0">But, while yet to the rowing she laboured, did Tiphys’ touch on the helm</p>
			<p class="i0">Ease her, and under the keel hath it rolled, as leapt the prow:</p>
			<p class="i0">High hath it lifted the stern, and afar hath it swept her now</p>
			<p class="i0">From the rocks, and the galley ’twixt earth and heaven was tossed on high.</p>
			<p class="i0">But Euphêmus strode down the line of the rowers with cheering cry</p>
			<p class="i0">To bend to the oars with their uttermost might: and they tore through the deep</p>
			<p class="i0">The blades with a shout. And far as a ship to the stroke will leap,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even twice so far leapt Argo away, and the tough oars bent</p>
			<p class="i0">Like bended bows, such might to the stroke the heroes lent.</p>
			<p class="i0">On-rushing, up-towering, a breaker came, overarched like a cave;</p>
			<p class="i0">But suddenly light as a roller she rode the furious wave.</p>
			<p class="i0">Forward through yawning gulfs she plunged; but caught was her prow</p>
			<p class="i0">By a whirlpool sea-rush betwixt the Clashers:⁠—on each side now</p>
			<p class="i0">Swaying forward they thundered, and shivered the hull to the coming shock.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then did Athênê backward thrust one massy rock</p>
			<p class="i0">With her left hand, touching their bark with her right to speed her through;</p>
			<p class="i0">On, like a wingèd arrow ’twixt billow and air she flew.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet shorn away was the tip of the galley’s arching stern</p>
			<p class="i0">By the rocks in their clash never-resting. Then did Athênê return</p>
			<p class="i0">Far up to Olympus soaring, when now their peril was past.</p>
			<p class="i0">But the Crags in the selfsame place that moment were rooted fast</p>
			<p class="i0">Each hard against other for ever, as fated they were to remain</p>
			<p class="i0">By the Blest, when a man in his ship should have passed therethrough unslain.</p>
			<p class="i0">And now for the first from dismay blood-curdling did those breathe free,</p>
			<p class="i0">Now gazing around on the sky, now o’er the expanse of sea</p>
			<p class="i0">Far stretching away; for they weened that from Hades safe they had fled.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then first of them Tiphys brake that awe-struck hush, and he said:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Now I deem we have ’scaped it, we and the Argo, in very deed:</p>
			<p class="i0">And herein none other, save only Athênê, hath helped us at need,</p>
			<p class="i0">Who breathed into Argo spirit divine, when Argus the wright</p>
			<p class="i0">Knit her with bolts, that she could not be trapped in doom’s despite.</p>
			<p class="i0">O Aison’s son, for the hest of thy king no more fear thou,</p>
			<p class="i0">Since a God hath vouchsafed unto us to flee all scatheless now</p>
			<p class="i0">Through yonder rocks: yea, all thy toils which are yet to be done</p>
			<p class="i0">Shall lightly be compassed, as Phineus foretold, Agênor’s son.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake he; and forward past the Bithynian land he sped</p>
			<p class="i0">The ship right on through the midst of the sea. But Jason said⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">And sad was his voice and low as he answered the hero-chief:⁠—</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Ah, Tiphys, to what end thus wouldst thou hearten me in my grief?</p>
			<p class="i0">I have sinned: with baneful and cureless madness have I transgressed.</p>
			<p class="i0">For I ought, in the very hour when Pelias uttered his hest,</p>
			<p class="i0">To have straightway refused this Quest, yea, though I were doomed to die</p>
			<p class="i0">By the hands of tormentors, limb from limb hewn pitilessly.</p>
			<p class="i0">But exceeding dread and cares unendurable now be mine,</p>
			<p class="i0">With haunting fear as I sail the sea’s chill paths of brine</p>
			<p class="i0">In the ship, and with haunting fear wheresoever we set our feet</p>
			<p class="i0">On the land, for that foes evermore on every shore do we meet.</p>
			<p class="i0">And ever, when past is the day, through a night of sighs I wake,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even from the hour when first ye gathered for Jason’s sake,</p>
			<p class="i0">For all things aye taking thought. With a light heart cheerily</p>
			<p class="i0">Thou speak’st, who for nought but thine own life needest to care; but I</p>
			<p class="i0">For mine own care never a jot; but for this man and that man’s bane,</p>
			<p class="i0">And for thee, and for other my comrades I bear this burden of pain,</p>
			<p class="i0">Lest haply never I bring you alive unto Hellas again.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake he, trying the heroes’ souls; but with words of cheer</p>
			<p class="i0">Shouted they: glowed his heart that gallant chiding to hear.</p>
			<p class="i0">And again he uplifted his voice, and he hailed that hero-crew:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘O friends, your manful spirit hath quickened my courage anew.</p>
			<p class="i0">Wherefore, not though through abysses of Hades my way should be,</p>
			<p class="i0">Will I suffer that dread shall lay hold on my soul, so steadfast do ye</p>
			<p class="i0">Abide amid heart-wringing terror⁠—yea, seeing that now through the strait</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the Clashing Rocks we have sailed, I trow there lieth in wait</p>
			<p class="i0">No terror hereafter like unto this, if in truth we obey</p>
			<p class="i0">The counsel of Phineus the seer, as we track the printless way.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake he; from words of misgiving their lips thenceforth they refrained:</p>
			<p class="i0">But they fell to the ceaseless labour of rowing; and quickly they gained</p>
			<p class="i0">Rheba the swift-flowing river: Kotône’s height they descried,</p>
			<p class="i0">And shortly thereafter past the Headland Dark did they glide.</p>
			<p class="i0">Thereby was Phyllêis’ outfall, where in the days bygone</p>
			<p class="i0">In the halls of his palace Dipsakus welcomed Athamas’ son,</p>
			<p class="i0">What time from Orchomenus-city he fled, on the winged ram borne.</p>
			<p class="i0">A Nymph of the Mead was his mother: the tyrant’s arrogant scorn</p>
			<p class="i0">He loathed, but contented beside his father’s streams dwelt he</p>
			<p class="i0">With his mother, and pastured his sheep in the meadows beside the sea.</p>
			<p class="i0">And quickly they sighted his shrine, and the broad low banks of the stream,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the plain, and of Kalpê’s deep-flowing waters they caught the gleam</p>
			<p class="i0">For a moment, and passed it by, and still, when the daylight waned,</p>
			<p class="i0">’Neath the stars of the windless night at the tireless oars they strained.</p>
			<p class="i0">And even as ploughing oxen cleaving the rain-soaked soil</p>
			<p class="i0">Labour the furrows adown, and abundant sweat of their toil</p>
			<p class="i0">Streameth from flank and from neck, and aye from beneath the yoke</p>
			<p class="i0">Are the tired beasts turning their eyes askance; and as furnace-smoke</p>
			<p class="i0">In hot gasps snort they the breath from their mouths; and, deep in the clay</p>
			<p class="i0">Thrusting their hoofs, at the plough they tug through the livelong day;</p>
			<p class="i0">So toiled those heroes tugging the oars through the brine alway.</p>
			<p class="i1">When the dawn divine not yet hath arisen, nor utter night</p>
			<p class="i0">Reigneth, but over the darkness stealeth a faint grey light⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">The twilight-tide is it named of slumber-stinted men⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Into a desolate Thynian island’s haven then</p>
			<p class="i0">They ran, and with weary toil sore-spent won they to the strand.</p>
			<p class="i0">And to them lo, Lêto’s son, coming up from the Libyan land,</p>
			<p class="i0">As he fared to the countless folk of the Hyperborean race,</p>
			<p class="i0">Appeared; and his tresses golden-gleaming about his face,</p>
			<p class="i0">Ever, as onward he moved, in the breezes floated and swung.</p>
			<p class="i0">In his left hand held he the silver bow, and his quiver slung</p>
			<p class="i0">From his shoulders was gleaming adown his back: and the isle all o’er</p>
			<p class="i0">Quaked ’neath his feet, and surged the billow high on the shore.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then fell on them ’wildered fear as they looked: was none dared turn</p>
			<p class="i0">His face to gaze with his eyes on the God’s eyes lovely and stern.</p>
			<p class="i0">But with heads bowed down to the earth they stood: and onward he passed</p>
			<p class="i0">Faring afar through the air to the sea. Then Orpheus at last</p>
			<p class="i0">After long hush spake, and he cried to the hero-chieftains all:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Come now, an ye will, this island the Sacred Isle let us call</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Apollo the Dawn-god, seeing at dawning revealed to our eyes</p>
			<p class="i0">O’er the isle he hath passed. Such things as we have let us sacrifice,</p>
			<p class="i0">On the shore upbuilding an altar: and if in the days to come</p>
			<p class="i0">To Haimonia-land he vouchsafe us return, safe-speeding us home,</p>
			<p class="i0">Then with the thighs of hornèd goats will we pay our vow.</p>
			<p class="i0">But with sacrifice-steam and libation I bid you propitiate now</p>
			<p class="i0">The God. Be gracious, O King manifested!⁠—be gracious thou!’</p>
			<p class="i1">So did he counsel: an altar with speed ’gan these uppile</p>
			<p class="i0">Of shingle, and those through the island wandered, seeking the while</p>
			<p class="i0">If they haply might light on a fawn, or the wild goat’s restless brood</p>
			<p class="i0">That in multitudes seek their pasturage far in the depths of the wood.</p>
			<p class="i0">And Lêto’s son unto these gave booty; and carving out</p>
			<p class="i0">The thighs, on the altar they laid them with fat-folds wrapped about:</p>
			<p class="i0">And they burnt them, hailing Apollo the Lord of the Fair Dayspring.</p>
			<p class="i0">And around the blaze they stood in a wide encompassing ring:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘All hail, fair Healer Apollo! Hail, thou Healer of Bane!’</p>
			<p class="i0">They sang: and amidst them Oeagrius’ goodly son hath ta’en</p>
			<p class="i0">The Bistonian lyre, and uplifted his voice in the clear-ringing lay,</p>
			<p class="i0">Singing how on the rocky flanks of Parnassus once on a day</p>
			<p class="i0">Delphinê the monster the young God slew with his arrow-flight,</p>
			<p class="i0">When he yet was a beardless youth, rejoicing in locks of light:⁠—</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Be gracious!’ he sang, ‘Unshorn, O King, be thy tresses aye,</p>
			<p class="i0">Ever unravaged, as Heaven’s will is! One only may lay</p>
			<p class="i0">Love-lingering hands thereupon, even Lêto Kôeus’ child.’</p>
			<p class="i0">And the daughters of Pleistus oft, the Korykian Nymphs of the wild,</p>
			<p class="i0">Caught up the refrain⁠—‘Hail, Healer!’ their gladdening echoes ring.</p>
			<p class="i0">So born was the lovely hymn that to Phœbus yet men sing.</p>
			<p class="i1">Then, when with the dance and the song they had honoured the God, they swore,</p>
			<p class="i0">By the holy libations taking the oath, that evermore</p>
			<p class="i0">They would stand each one by his fellow, and help in unity.</p>
			<p class="i0">On the victims laid they their hands as they spake; and yet may ye see</p>
			<p class="i0">A temple to gracious Unity there, which their own hands reared</p>
			<p class="i0">In the day that they took for their wayfaring-fellow the Goddess revered.</p>
			<p class="i1">And now when the dawn of the third day came, a fresh strong wind</p>
			<p class="i0">From the west upsprang, and they left the island-cliffs behind.</p>
			<p class="i0">Overagainst the mouth of the river Sangarius then,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the land exceeding rich of the Mariandynian men,</p>
			<p class="i0">The streams of Lykus, the mere of Anthemoïsia⁠—these</p>
			<p class="i0">They sighted, and ran thereby, and ever the sheets in the breeze</p>
			<p class="i0">Quivered, and all the tackling, as onward they sped their flight.</p>
			<p class="i0">But at dawn⁠—forasmuch as the wind had fallen asleep in the night⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Gladly the haven they won of the Acherusian Head.</p>
			<p class="i0">Upward it soareth to heaven with cliffs no foot may tread,</p>
			<p class="i0">Fronting the sea Bithynian; below it the craggy rocks</p>
			<p class="i0">Ever lashed by the brine stand rooted: around them with thunder-shocks</p>
			<p class="i0">Ever crashes the wallowing surge; and above the turmoil on high</p>
			<p class="i0">Wide-spreading planes on the brow of the mountain rest on the sky.</p>
			<p class="i0">And aback of the headland, and sloped therefrom away from the shore</p>
			<p class="i0">Is a glen in a hollow: therein is a cave, even Hades’ Door,</p>
			<p class="i0">With forest and rocks overroofed, and thereout an icy breath,</p>
			<p class="i0">Chill-blowing unceasingly up from unfathomed abysses of death,</p>
			<p class="i0">Freezeth the dews evermore, neither melteth the glistering rime</p>
			<p class="i0">From the leaves, till the hour when the sun to his noonday height doth climb.</p>
			<p class="i0">And o’er that headland grim doth silence never brood,</p>
			<p class="i0">But it murmureth ever with sound confused of the booming flood</p>
			<p class="i0">And of leaves that shiver in blasts from the mountain-clefts that blow.</p>
			<p class="i0">There also the outfall is of the river Acheron’s flow:</p>
			<p class="i0">Through the heart of the headland bursting it hurleth its flood to the sea</p>
			<p class="i0">Eastward, through yawning chasms plunging suddenly.</p>
			<p class="i0">But ‘Saviour of Sailors’ in days thereafter called they its name,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even Megaran folk of Nisaia, when seeking a home they came</p>
			<p class="i0">In the Mariandynian land; for deliverance from peril it gave</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto them and their ships from the stress of stormy wind and wave.</p>
			<p class="i0">Through the gorge of the cape Acherusian ran the heroes their prow,</p>
			<p class="i0">And seaward-facing abode; for the wind had lulled but now.</p>
			<p class="i1">Nor long unmarked of Lykus, the lord of the selfsame land,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the Mariandynian folk, they came, that hero-band,</p>
			<p class="i0">The slayers of Amykus, seeing their rumour before them had run:</p>
			<p class="i0">So a league with the wanderers made they because of the great deed done.</p>
			<p class="i0">And, for Prince Polydeukes, they hailed him as though of the Gods he were,</p>
			<p class="i0">Thither flocking from every side; for through many a stormy year</p>
			<p class="i0">Had they warred with the proud Bebrykians, and faced the battle-blast.</p>
			<p class="i0">So they went up into the city, and all together they passed</p>
			<p class="i0">Into Lykus’ palace, and that day through by the meat and the bowl</p>
			<p class="i0">In all lovingkindness they sat, and with converse gladdened their soul.</p>
			<p class="i0">And Aison’s scion his lineage told, and the names of the rest</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the hero-helpers withal, and the tale of Pelias’ hest;</p>
			<p class="i0">And how the women of Lemnos in kindness dealt with them well;</p>
			<p class="i0">And of all that in Kyzikus, land of the Dolian men, befell;</p>
			<p class="i0">How to Mysia they came, and to Kios, where Herakles lion-souled</p>
			<p class="i0">Sore loth they forsook; and the words of the Sea-god Glaukus he told;</p>
			<p class="i0">And how they laid the Bebrykian people and Amykus low;</p>
			<p class="i0">And of Phineus’ prophecies told he and all his weary woe;</p>
			<p class="i0">And how they escaped through the Crags Dark-blue, and beheld on the isle</p>
			<p class="i0">Lêto’s son: and still, as he told all, Lykus the while</p>
			<p class="i0">Hearkened in gladness of soul; but with grief did the heart of him ache</p>
			<p class="i0">For Herakles left behind, and unto them all he spake:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘O friends, what a hero’s help ye have lost for the way ye must go</p>
			<p class="i0">Far-sailing to halls of Aiêtes!⁠—myself have beheld him, and know</p>
			<p class="i0">What manner of man he was; for in Daskylus’ halls did he stand,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even here in the halls of my sire, when he marched through the Asian land</p>
			<p class="i0">Afoot, that belt of the battle-revelling queen to win,</p>
			<p class="i0">Hippolytê: then did he find me with youth’s soft down on my chin.</p>
			<p class="i0">Here, when Priolaus my brother was unto his grave-mound borne⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Who was slain by our Mysian foes, and for whom the people mourn</p>
			<p class="i0">With exceeding piteous dirges from that day forth⁠—in the lists</p>
			<p class="i0">Against Titias the strong he stood, and prevailed in the strife of the fists</p>
			<p class="i0">Over him who amidst of our young men never his match had found</p>
			<p class="i0">In stature and might: but Herakles dashed his teeth on the ground.</p>
			<p class="i0">Beneath my father’s sceptre withal the Mysians he bowed,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the Phrygians, for hard by our marches their fields our foemen ploughed.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the tribes of Bithynians he smote, and won their land by his might,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even to the outfall of Rheba, and unto Kolonê’s height.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the Paphlagonians of Pelops yielded, nor faced that foe,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even all round whom Billaios’ darkling waters flow.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then came the Bebrykians; and Amykus’ lawless tyranny,</p>
			<p class="i0">While Herakles dwelt afar, reft these my possessions from me,</p>
			<p class="i0">Long carving out of my land huge cantles, till stretched the line</p>
			<p class="i0">Of their bounds to the meads where Hypius’ deep-flowing waters shine.</p>
			<p class="i0">But ye made them to pay requital for all: it was not, I wot,</p>
			<p class="i0">But by will of the Gods that war by Tyndareus’ son was brought</p>
			<p class="i0">That day on Bebrykia’s sons, when their champion giant he slew.</p>
			<p class="i0">Wherefore what thanks soever Lykus may render to you</p>
			<p class="i0">With joy will I render; for meet and right it is that the weak,</p>
			<p class="i0">When the strong for their helping arise, by deeds their thanks should speak.</p>
			<p class="i0">Lo, Daskylus now will I bid that he be of your company,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even my son, and if this man your fellow in wayfaring be,</p>
			<p class="i0">With kindly greeting shall all men hail you, and welcome fain</p>
			<p class="i0">Through all your way, till the mouth of the river Thermodon ye gain.</p>
			<p class="i0">But to Tyndareus’ sons on the Acherusian foreland’s steep</p>
			<p class="i0">A temple on high will I rear: far off across the deep</p>
			<p class="i0">Shall seafarers mark that fane, and to these in prayer shall they call.</p>
			<p class="i0">Rich fields of the fertile plain will I set apart withal</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto them, as unto the Gods, without the city-wall.’</p>
			<p class="i1">Even so through the livelong day at the banquet revelled they on.</p>
			<p class="i0">But with dawning down to the strand they hied them, in haste to be gone.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then went with them Lykus, and gifts in their galley to bear gave he</p>
			<p class="i0">Without number, and sent his son, their voyaging comrade to be.</p>
			<p class="i1">There did the doom fate-spoken descend upon Abas’ son,</p>
			<p class="i0">Idmon, in soothsaying peerless: but safety for him was there none</p>
			<p class="i0">In his soothsaying lore, for that now must he die by the doom decreed.</p>
			<p class="i0">For it chanced that there lay in a reedy river’s water-mead,</p>
			<p class="i0">Cooling his flanks and his mighty belly wallowed in mire,</p>
			<p class="i0">A wild boar gleaming-tusked, so baleful a monster and dire</p>
			<p class="i0">That of him were the meadow-haunting Nymphs themselves adread.</p>
			<p class="i0">No man knew his lair; alone in the fen wide-stretching he fed.</p>
			<p class="i0">But it chanced unto Abas’ son o’er the marshy rises to fare</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the plain, and the beast on a sudden, forth of his unseen lair</p>
			<p class="i0">High-leaping out of the reed-bed, gashed in his sidelong rush</p>
			<p class="i0">His thigh, that the sinews were severed, and snapped was the bone by the tush.</p>
			<p class="i0">With one sharp cry to the earth he fell, and with answering shout</p>
			<p class="i0">His comrades ran to the stricken; and Peleus in haste thrust out</p>
			<p class="i0">With his hunting-spear, as the murderous monster fled to the fen.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then turned he, and charged full on them; but Idas stabbed him then,</p>
			<p class="i0">And harshly screaming he fell impaled on the keen spear-head.</p>
			<p class="i0">There on the earth as he lay, unheeded they left him dead.</p>
			<p class="i0">But their friend to the galley in death-throes gasping his comrades bore</p>
			<p class="i0">Sore grieved: but he died in their arms or ever they reached the shore.</p>
			<p class="i1">Then from their voyaging stayed they, they cared not now to depart:</p>
			<p class="i0">To their dead friend’s burial turned they in heaviness of heart.</p>
			<p class="i0">For three whole days they wailed, and their dead, when the fourth day broke,</p>
			<p class="i0">Did they bury as one of the princes; and Lykus and all his folk</p>
			<p class="i0">Had part in the woeful rites; and victims of sheep not a few,</p>
			<p class="i0">As meet and right for the dead it is, by his grave they slew.</p>
			<p class="i0">And a barrow that standeth yet unto this man there did they raise,</p>
			<p class="i0">And a token is there, to be seen by the men of the unborn days,</p>
			<p class="i0">A galley’s roller of olive-wood; into leaf doth it break</p>
			<p class="i0">But a little below Acherusia’s height: and⁠—if I may speak</p>
			<p class="i0">This too by the power of the Muses that stirreth within my breast⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">To Bœotian men and Nisaian Apollo spake his behest,</p>
			<p class="i0">Worship to him as unto their city’s protector to pay,</p>
			<p class="i0">And around that ancient olive a city’s foundations to lay.</p>
			<p class="i0">But by this is tradition dim, and they render the honour-meed</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto one Agamestor, and not unto Idmon, Aiolus’ seed.</p>
			<p class="i1">Now who was the next that died?⁠—for the heroes again in grief</p>
			<p class="i0">Another earth-mound heaped for another perished chief:</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, there be memorials twain of the wanderers yet high-reared.</p>
			<p class="i0">Now telleth the tale how Tiphys the Hagniad died; for his weird</p>
			<p class="i0">Was to voyage no further thereafter; but him, far away from his home,</p>
			<p class="i0">Short sickness hushed into sleep, the endless sleep of the tomb,</p>
			<p class="i0">While yet were the death-rites rendered to Abas’ son by the folk:</p>
			<p class="i0">And grief unendurable seized them for this new ruin-stroke.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, and when hard by the seer him too they had buried there,</p>
			<p class="i0">On the shore of the sea did they cast them adown in utter despair,</p>
			<p class="i0">Rolled in their mantles from head to foot, all hushed: no part</p>
			<p class="i0">Had meat nor drink in their thoughts; but in bitterness of heart</p>
			<p class="i0">They spake not, for hope of returning was dead in each man’s breast.</p>
			<p class="i0">And for grief had they gone no further, had there made end of the Quest,</p>
			<p class="i0">But that Hêrê enkindled exceeding courage within the soul</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Ankaius, whom Astypaleia, where Imbrasus’ waters roll,</p>
			<p class="i0">Bare to the Sea-god, a man most deft in the steering of ships.</p>
			<p class="i0">So now unto Peleus he turned him, and spake with eager lips:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Is it well done, Aiakus’ son, that, forgetting the great work, we</p>
			<p class="i0">On an alien shore should linger and linger?⁠—I, even he</p>
			<p class="i0">Whom Jason brought on the Quest of the Fleece from Parthenia afar,</p>
			<p class="i0">Have knowledge of ships⁠—yea, even beyond my cunning in war.</p>
			<p class="i0">Wherefore, as touching the plight of our ship, no whit fear thou.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, others in steering deft came hitherward with us, I trow:</p>
			<p class="i0">Whomsoever of these at the helm we set, no hurt shall befall</p>
			<p class="i0">Our seafaring. Haste then, and unto our fellows tell forth all,</p>
			<p class="i0">And unto the high emprise arouse them with heartening word.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake he; the soul of the other with gladness exceeding was stirred.</p>
			<p class="i0">No whit did he tarry, but straight in the midst of them all did he say,</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Ho, friends!⁠—why cherish we thus a bootless sorrow for aye?</p>
			<p class="i0">For I ween these twain by the doom first drawn with their life’s lot died:</p>
			<p class="i0">But in this our array there be found with us other helmsmen beside,</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, many an one: let us put them to proof: make we no stay;</p>
			<p class="i0">But rouse ye unto the deed, and cast your griefs away.’</p>
			<p class="i1">But in helpless despair unto him did the son of Aison say:</p>
			<p class="i0">‘O Aiakus’ son, these helmsmen of thine⁠—now where be they?</p>
			<p class="i0">For they which concerning their cunning therein once vaunted loud,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even these yet more than I with vexation of spirit are bowed.</p>
			<p class="i0">For us then, as for the dead, ill doom doth mine heart foretell,</p>
			<p class="i0">Whose lot shall be never to win to the town of Aiêtes the fell,</p>
			<p class="i0">No, neither ever again to pass through the grim sea-gate</p>
			<p class="i0">To the land of Hellas returning; but now shall an evil fate,</p>
			<p class="i0">As we wax old deedless, enshroud us nameless and fameless here.’</p>
			<p class="i1">He spake: but Ankaius eagerly proffered himself to steer</p>
			<p class="i0">The sea-swift ship; for within him the power of the Goddess was strong.</p>
			<p class="i0">Erginus and Nauplius then, and Euphêmus forth from the throng</p>
			<p class="i0">Strode, eager all for the helm: but their comrades drew back these,</p>
			<p class="i0">For that none would they have but Ankaius to guide them over the seas.</p>
			<p class="i1">So then on the twelfth day hied them adown the Argo’s crew</p>
			<p class="i0">At dawn; for the West-wind now, the mighty wafter, blew.</p>
			<p class="i0">Speedily out of the Acheron’s mouth with the oars they passed,</p>
			<p class="i0">And they shook the broad sail forth to the wind, and far and fast</p>
			<p class="i0">With outspread canvas cleaving the leagues of summer wave,</p>
			<p class="i0">By the outfall of Kallichorus the river swiftly they drave,</p>
			<p class="i0">The place where the child Nysaian of Zeus, as the tale doth tell,</p>
			<p class="i0">When, leaving the tribes of the Indians, in Thêbê he came to dwell,</p>
			<p class="i0">Held revel, and dances in front of the cave did the God array</p>
			<p class="i0">Wherein, through the nights unsmiling, in hallowed slumber he lay.</p>
			<p class="i0">Wherefore the people called it the River of Dances Fair,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the cavern the Bedchamber, seeing a God once slumbered there.</p>
			<p class="i1">Thereafter espied they the barrow of Sthenelus, Aktor’s son,</p>
			<p class="i0">Who, when from valorous battle against the Amazon</p>
			<p class="i0">He was turning aback⁠—for with Herakles thither to war had he hied⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">By an arrow was smitten, and there on the surf-lashed sea-strand died.</p>
			<p class="i0">Nor yet for a space did they sail on thence; for Persephonê, won</p>
			<p class="i0">By his prayers and tears, sent forth the spirit of Aktor’s son</p>
			<p class="i0">A moment to gaze upon men of passions like to his own.</p>
			<p class="i0">So he mounted the crest of his barrow: on Argo looked he down,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even such to behold as when to the war he went. On his head</p>
			<p class="i0">His beautiful helm four-crested flashed with its plume blood-red.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then down into blackness of darkness returned he: they looked thereon,</p>
			<p class="i0">And marvelled. Then by the word of prophecy Ampykus’ son,</p>
			<p class="i0">Mopsus, caused them to land, and to pay drink-offerings due.</p>
			<p class="i0">So furled they the sail in haste, and the hawsers forth they threw;</p>
			<p class="i0">And there on the strand round Sthenelus’ grave-mound gathered they.</p>
			<p class="i0">Drink-offerings they poured, and the fatlings of sacrifice did they slay.</p>
			<p class="i0">And, besides the libations, an altar they built, laying thighs on the blaze</p>
			<p class="i0">To Apollo the Saviour of Ships; and his lyre did Orpheus upraise</p>
			<p class="i0">And dedicate; wherefore the ‘Lyre’ from that day called they the place.</p>
			<p class="i1">Then straight, when the wind blew strong, did they board the galley again,</p>
			<p class="i0">And they dropped the sail from the yard, and the feet thereof did they strain</p>
			<p class="i0">On either hand with the sheets; and over the sea did she fly</p>
			<p class="i0">Swift-racing, as when some hawk through the welkin soaring high</p>
			<p class="i0">To the breeze committeth his wings, and is borne fast: onward sweeping</p>
			<p class="i0">He stirreth them not, on restful pinions in mid-heaven sleeping.</p>
			<p class="i0">And lo, by the streams of Parthenius’ seaward-murmuring water,</p>
			<p class="i0">Most softly-sliding of rivers, they passed, where Lêto’s Daughter,</p>
			<p class="i0">What time from the hunting she cometh, ere up to the heaven she go,</p>
			<p class="i0">In its lovely ripples cooleth her limbs from the summer-glow.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then through the night-tide onward and onward unresting they sped.</p>
			<p class="i0">Past Sêsamus, past the long Erythinian steeps they fled;</p>
			<p class="i0">By Krôbialus and by Krômne, Kytôrus the forest-crowned;</p>
			<p class="i0">Then, as the sun’s shafts glanced o’er the waters, swept they around</p>
			<p class="i0">Karambis; and still by an endless strand the oars they plied</p>
			<p class="i0">Through the livelong day, and on through the night, when the daylight died.</p>
			<p class="i1">On the shore of Assyria they landed, where Zeus to Sinopê, the child</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Asôpus, had given a home. By his own rash promise beguiled</p>
			<p class="i0">Zeus’ self bestowed on the maiden the gift of her maidenhood.</p>
			<p class="i0">For he longed for her love, and he promised that, whatsoever she would,</p>
			<p class="i0">He would give her her heart’s desire, and he sealed the pledge with his nod:</p>
			<p class="i0">And she in her subtlety asked her maidenhood of the God.</p>
			<p class="i0">So in like wise made she a mock of Apollo, whose soul was fain</p>
			<p class="i0">Of her couch, and of Halys the river withal. Nor did any man gain</p>
			<p class="i0">His desire, in the arms of love to embrace her, and humble her pride.</p>
			<p class="i0">Now there did noble Trikkaian Deïmachus’ sons abide⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Even three, Deïleon, Autolykus, Phlogius withal, were these⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Since the day when they wandered away from the host of Herakles.</p>
			<p class="i0">And these, when they marked draw near the warrior-chiefs’ array,</p>
			<p class="i0">Went shoreward to meet them, and told them in all truth who were they.</p>
			<p class="i0">Neither willed they there to abide any longer, but fared with the crew</p>
			<p class="i0">In Argo, so soon as the cloud-dispelling south-wind blew.</p>
			<p class="i0">So in their company went they borne by the breeze swift-blowing,</p>
			<p class="i0">And Halys the river they left, and Iris beside him flowing,</p>
			<p class="i0">And the river-delta land of Assyria: the selfsame day</p>
			<p class="i0">They rounded the headland that sheltered the Amazons’ harbour-bay.</p>
			<p class="i1">Melanippê, Arêtus’ child, forth-faring, by ambuscade</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Herakles there was caught, and her sister Hippolytê paid</p>
			<p class="i0">For her ransom the Belt of renown, the splendour-gleaming band:</p>
			<p class="i0">So the hero sent her back, and she gat no hurt of his hand.</p>
			<p class="i0">In the harbour that beareth her name, where seaward Thermodon pours</p>
			<p class="i0">Ran they ashore, for that contrary now was the wind to their course.</p>
			<p class="i0">That river⁠—on earth there is not his like; there is none that doth spread</p>
			<p class="i0">Over the land so many streams from his fountain-head.</p>
			<p class="i0">There should lack but four of a hundred, if one should tell them o’er</p>
			<p class="i0">Each after each, and from one true fountain do all these pour.</p>
			<p class="i0">Down from the mountains high to the plains it sendeth its rills,</p>
			<p class="i0">From the heights which be called, men say, the Amazonian Hills.</p>
			<p class="i0">Thence over the hilly country inland-straying they flow</p>
			<p class="i0">Ever onward, albeit their paths in manifold windings go</p>
			<p class="i0">This way and that evermore, wheresoever on low-lying ground</p>
			<p class="i0">They may light, so roll they along; and this one afar shall be found,</p>
			<p class="i0">And that one anear; and nameless many an one is lost</p>
			<p class="i0">Swallowed up in the sands; and a blended remnant of all that host</p>
			<p class="i0">Into perilous Pontus plunge with arching crests high-tossed.</p>
			<p class="i0">And, there as they tarried, in battle against the Amazon horde</p>
			<p class="i0">Had they closed, and in that grim strife had blood been as water outpoured;</p>
			<p class="i0">For all ungentle the Amazons are, neither have they regard</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto justice, the terrible ones who the plain Doiantian ward;</p>
			<p class="i0">But the deeds of the War-god they love, and outrage of tyrannous scorn;</p>
			<p class="i0">For the daughters of Ares they are, of the Nymph Harmonia born:</p>
			<p class="i0">For she bare to the Man-destroyer the battle-revelling maids,</p>
			<p class="i0">When their couch was spread mid the folds of Alkmonian forest-glades:⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">But again from Zeus ’gan blow the breath of the fair south-wind;</p>
			<p class="i0">So sped by the blast they left the rounded foreland behind,</p>
			<p class="i0">While the Themiskyreian Amazons yet were arming for war:</p>
			<p class="i0">For in one great city assembled they dwelt not, but sundered afar</p>
			<p class="i0">From their fellows throughout the land were the tribes of them parted in three;</p>
			<p class="i0">In the one place Themiskyreians, whose queen was Hippolytê</p>
			<p class="i0">In that old time; and there the Lykastians dwelt, and anon</p>
			<p class="i0">Dart-hurling Chadisians yonder. The next day sped they on,</p>
			<p class="i0">And at nightfall unto the land of the Chalyban men they won.</p>
			<p class="i1">That folk drive never the ploughing oxen afield: no part</p>
			<p class="i0">Have they in the planting of fruit that as honey is sweet to the heart;</p>
			<p class="i0">Neither lead they the pasturing flocks over meadows a-glitter with dew:</p>
			<p class="i0">But the ribs of the stubborn earth for the treasure of iron they hew,</p>
			<p class="i0">And by merchandise of the same do they live: never dawning broke</p>
			<p class="i0">Bringing respite of toil unto them, but ever midst mirk of smoke</p>
			<p class="i0">And flame at the forge are they moiling and plying the weary stroke.</p>
			<p class="i1">Round the headland of Zeus the All-begetter swept they then;</p>
			<p class="i0">And safely they sped by the land of the Tibarenian men.</p>
			<p class="i0">When a woman in that land beareth a child to her lord, on his bed</p>
			<p class="i0">Doth her husband cast him adown, and he groaneth with close-swathed head</p>
			<p class="i0">As in anguish of travail, the while the woman with tender care</p>
			<p class="i0">Doth nurse him and feed, and for him the child-birth bath doth prepare.</p>
			<p class="i1">The Sacred Mountain thereafter, and that land passed they by</p>
			<p class="i0">Wherein the Mossynœcians dwell amid mountains high</p>
			<p class="i0">In their towers of timber goodly-wrought, and they call the same</p>
			<p class="i0">‘Mossyni,’ wherefrom moreover the nation hath gotten its name.</p>
			<p class="i0">Strange is the justice of these, and customs uncouth have they.</p>
			<p class="i0">Whatsoe’er we be wont to do before men in the sight of the day,</p>
			<p class="i0">Or the market-stead, all this they perform their houses within;</p>
			<p class="i0">And whatso we do in our chambers apart, they account it not sin</p>
			<p class="i0">Without, in the midst of the streets of their city, to do unblamed.</p>
			<p class="i0">No modesty have they in love, but as rooting swine unshamed,</p>
			<p class="i0">No whit abashed for the eyes of beholders that stand thereby,</p>
			<p class="i0">On the earth for their bed of love with their women unwedded they lie.</p>
			<p class="i0">In their loftiest block-house sitteth their king, and holdeth his court,</p>
			<p class="i0">Decreeing his righteous judgments to them that thither resort.</p>
			<p class="i0">Ah, luckless wight!⁠—if perchance in his sentence he swerve from the right,</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto prison they hale him, therein to fast till falleth the night.</p>
			<p class="i1">These passed they by, and well-nigh overagainst the shores</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the Isle of Ares they cleft them a path with unresting oars</p>
			<p class="i0">Through the livelong day, for the gentle breeze in the gloaming died.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then all in a moment one of the War-god’s birds they espied,</p>
			<p class="i0">Which haunt that isle, through the welkin darting high overhead;</p>
			<p class="i0">And behold, his pinions he shook, and down on the ship as she sped</p>
			<p class="i0">A feather keen hath he shot: to the leftward shoulder it sprang</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Oïleus: he dropped from his hands his oar at the sudden pang</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the stroke, and they marvelled all when the feather-arrow they saw.</p>
			<p class="i0">But the shaft from the flesh did his rowing-mate Eribôtes draw;</p>
			<p class="i0">And he bound up the wound; for his baldric-band he unclasped, that bare</p>
			<p class="i0">His sword-sheath hanging beside him. Sweeping on through the air</p>
			<p class="i0">Came another of those fell birds: but already the bow was bent</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the hero Klytius, Eurytus’ son: from the string hath he sent</p>
			<p class="i0">A swift-flying arrow against that fowl, and the shaft struck home.</p>
			<p class="i0">Down whirling beside the swift ship splashed the bird in the foam.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then cried Amphidamas Aleüs’ son, and thus spake he:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Nigh to us now is the Island of Ares: ye know it, who see</p>
			<p class="i0">Yon fowl of ravin; and little shall arrows avail us, I trow,</p>
			<p class="i0">To win us a peaceful landing thereon; but contrive we now</p>
			<p class="i0">Some other device for our help, if indeed we be minded to land,</p>
			<p class="i0">Remembering Phineus’ word, and the sightless seer’s command.</p>
			<p class="i0">For not great Herakles’ self, to Arcadia-land when he came,</p>
			<p class="i0">Availed with his arrows to drive away those birds that swam</p>
			<p class="i0">The Stymphalian mere: yea, I with mine eyes beheld that thing.</p>
			<p class="i0">But he stood on a crag exceeding high, loud-clattering</p>
			<p class="i0">With clash and clang in his hands his brazen battle-gear;</p>
			<p class="i0">And far away did they flee wild-screaming in panic fear.</p>
			<p class="i0">Wherefore contrive we now even such device as his⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, I will speak it, who heretofore have thought upon this:⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Set we upon our heads our helmets of lofty crest,</p>
			<p class="i0">And changing about in turn let the half of us row, and the rest</p>
			<p class="i0">With polished lances and bucklers fence the galley about;</p>
			<p class="i0">And all with one accord upraise ye a mighty shout,</p>
			<p class="i0">That the birds by the noise may be scared, by the wild unwonted cry,</p>
			<p class="i0">As they look on our nodding crests and the bright spears tossed on high.</p>
			<p class="i0">And if through the storm of their shafts to the island itself we shall win,</p>
			<p class="i0">Then with clashing of brazen bucklers raise ye a mighty din.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake he, and good in the sight of them all that counsel seemed.</p>
			<p class="i0">On the heads of the heroes straightway the brazen helmets gleamed</p>
			<p class="i0">Terribly flashing; above them tossed the plumes blood-red.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the half of them now in their turn the galley with oars on-sped;</p>
			<p class="i0">And with lances and shields did the rest for Argo a covering raise.</p>
			<p class="i0">And as when with tiling a man hath roofed his dwelling-place,</p>
			<p class="i0">For a beauty upon his abode and a fence from the rain thereto,</p>
			<p class="i0">And close-set each after each are they ranged in order due;</p>
			<p class="i0">Even so did they lock their shields, so roofed they the galley o’er.</p>
			<p class="i0">And as when from a warrior-throng upriseth the onset-roar,</p>
			<p class="i0">When the ranks are sweeping on, when the squadrons in battle close,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even so from the galley on high to the welkin the shout of them rose.</p>
			<p class="i0">Now none of the birds yet saw they: but when, as they touched the strand</p>
			<p class="i0">Of the island, they clashed on their bucklers, straightway on every hand</p>
			<p class="i0">From the earth by tens of thousands uprose they in sudden dread.</p>
			<p class="i0">And as when by the Son of Kronos the hail thick-falling is shed</p>
			<p class="i0">From the clouds on a town and its dwellings; the house-abiders the while,</p>
			<p class="i0">As they hearken the clatter that rattles unceasing on timber and tile,</p>
			<p class="i0">Untroubled are sitting: the stormy tide hath smitten the roof</p>
			<p class="i0">Not unforeseen; long since had they made all tempest-proof:</p>
			<p class="i0">So on the men thick-showering feather-shafts did they pour,</p>
			<p class="i0">As they darted on high o’er the sea to the hills on the farther shore.</p>
			<p class="i1">Now what was the purpose of Phineus in bidding that hero-array</p>
			<p class="i0">Land on the War-god’s isle? What help against the day</p>
			<p class="i0">Of their need were they destined to win of their tarrying there on the way?</p>
			<p class="i1">The sons of Phrixus unto Orchomenus voyaging</p>
			<p class="i0">Had been sent from Aia forth by Kytaian Aiêtes the king.</p>
			<p class="i0">In a galley of Kolchis they sailed, that the measureless wealth might be theirs</p>
			<p class="i0">Of their sire, for in death had he so commanded these his heirs.</p>
			<p class="i0">And exceeding nigh that day to the isle had they drawn; but lo,</p>
			<p class="i0">The might of the wind of the north did Zeus awaken to blow,</p>
			<p class="i0">Marking with rain the watery path of Arcturus the star.</p>
			<p class="i0">Yet through the day-tide he stirred but the leaves on the mountains afar,</p>
			<p class="i0">Breathing but lightly over the uttermost ends of the sprays:</p>
			<p class="i0">But at night on the sea he descended, a tempest-Titan, to raise</p>
			<p class="i0">The surge with his blasts wild-shrieking: a black mist shrouded the sky,</p>
			<p class="i0">And never the gleam of a star might the mariners’ ken descry</p>
			<p class="i0">Through the clouds, but over the sea’s face brooded murky gloom.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the sons of Phrixus quaking for fear of a horrible doom</p>
			<p class="i0">Were helplessly hurled o’er the surges, and drenched with the flying spume.</p>
			<p class="i0">And the sail by the might of the blast was snatched away, and crashed</p>
			<p class="i0">Their ship’s hull, shattered in twain by the breakers thereover that dashed.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then by the Gods’ own prompting they clutched, and as one man clung</p>
			<p class="i0">Those four to a mighty spar⁠—for that many an one had been flung</p>
			<p class="i0">Wide from the scattered wreck⁠—firm-knit by the strong bolts’ clasp;</p>
			<p class="i0">And on to the isle, evermore but a little beyond death’s grasp,</p>
			<p class="i0">The waves and the sweep of the tempest bare them in misery.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then burst forth rain: no tongue could tell it⁠—it rained on the sea,</p>
			<p class="i0">On the island; and overagainst the island the floods of it fell</p>
			<p class="i0">Over all the land where the lawless Mossynœcians dwell.</p>
			<p class="i0">And along with the massy beam the sweep of the surges bore</p>
			<p class="i0">The sons of Phrixus on to the island’s rocky shore</p>
			<p class="i0">In the black dark night. But the floods of Zeus-descended rain</p>
			<p class="i0">Ceased with the dawn: and they met full soon, those companies twain.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then Argus first found voice, and to Argo’s crew spake he:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘We beseech you by All-beholder Zeus, whosoever ye be</p>
			<p class="i0">Of men, to have mercy and succour us now in our helplessness;</p>
			<p class="i0">For buffeted long have we been on the sea by the rough winds’ stress,</p>
			<p class="i0">Till sundered and shattered the beams of our crazy galley were.</p>
			<p class="i0">By your knees we entreat you then, if ye haply will hearken our prayer,</p>
			<p class="i0">To cover our nakedness now, and to take us whither ye go:</p>
			<p class="i0">As youths taking pity on youths, compassionate ye our woe!</p>
			<p class="i0">O reverence ye the strangers and suppliants for Zeus’s sake,</p>
			<p class="i0">Who is Lord of the stranger and suppliant⁠—yea, both names we take,</p>
			<p class="i0">Even strangers and suppliants of Zeus; and over us all is his eye.’</p>
			<p class="i1">But with heedful questioning then did Aison’s son reply,</p>
			<p class="i0">For he weened that fulfilment of Phineus’ prophecy now was nigh:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘All these will we give straightway with kindly heart and hand.</p>
			<p class="i0">But prithee now answer me truth, and tell how name ye the land</p>
			<p class="i0">Wherein ye be dwellers;⁠—for what need thus have ye sailed the sea?</p>
			<p class="i0">And your names of renown tell out, and the lineage whereof ye be.’</p>
			<p class="i1">Then Argus, as one in despairing wretchedness, answered low:</p>
			<p class="i0">‘How Phrixus the Aiolid came unto Aia from Hellas, I trow,</p>
			<p class="i0">Yourselves have certainly heard, have heard ere this the renown</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Phrixus, who came on a day to Aiêtes’ fortress-town</p>
			<p class="i0">Bestriding the ram which Hermes created all of gold:</p>
			<p class="i0">Yea, and the fleece thereof this day may ye yet behold;</p>
			<p class="i0">For the ram by the beast’s own counsel a sacrifice did he give</p>
			<p class="i0">To Kronion the Fugitives’ Zeus. And him did Aiêtes receive</p>
			<p class="i0">In his palace, and gave him to wife his daughter Chalkiopê,</p>
			<p class="i0">Nor for gifts of wooing he asked, in the joy of his heart and the glee.</p>
			<p class="i0">Of these twain we be the children; but Phrixus our father hath died,</p>
			<p class="i0">An old man stricken with years, in Aiêtes’ halls of pride.</p>
			<p class="i0">And straightway we, giving heed to the word that our father spake,</p>
			<p class="i0">To Orchomenus journey, Athamas’ goods in possession to take.</p>
			<p class="i0">And if, as thy word was, thou wouldst that our names be made known unto thee,</p>
			<p class="i0">Behold, Kytisôrus is this man named, and Phrontis he;</p>
			<p class="i0">And yonder is Melas, and Argus me myself shall ye call.’</p>
			<p class="i1">He spake, and for this forgathering glad were the heroes all:</p>
			<p class="i0">And they ministered unto them, marvelling much: but Jason again</p>
			<p class="i0">Spake as was meet and right, for his heart of the tidings was fain:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Lo now, of a surety kinsmen ye are of my sire, which have prayed</p>
			<p class="i0">That with merciful hearts we would look upon this your affliction, and aid.</p>
			<p class="i0">For of one blood, even brethren, Kretheus and Athamas were;</p>
			<p class="i0">And Kretheus’ grandson am I, with these my companions who fare</p>
			<p class="i0">From the selfsame Hellas, and unto Aiêtes’ city I sail.</p>
			<p class="i0">But of all these things to commune shall another time avail.</p>
			<p class="i0">But now put raiment upon you: it came to pass, I trow,</p>
			<p class="i0">By devising of Gods that ye came to mine hands in your sore need so.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake he, and out of the ship he gave them raiment to don.</p>
			<p class="i0">And all together now unto Ares’ fane are they gone</p>
			<p class="i0">For the sacrificing of sheep, and in all haste round about</p>
			<p class="i0">The altar they ranged them, which stood that roofless fane without,</p>
			<p class="i0">An altar of pebbles: within was a mighty stone upreared,</p>
			<p class="i0">A holy thing, which of yore the Amazons all revered.</p>
			<p class="i0">And it was not their wont, from the further strand when they came o’er the deep,</p>
			<p class="i0">On this same altar to burn in sacrifice oxen nor sheep;</p>
			<p class="i0">But horses they slew, and for this great herds were they wont to keep.</p>
			<p class="i0">There sacrificed they, and they ate of the flesh of the victims slain.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then Aison’s son in their midst uprose, and he spake yet again:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Zeus’ self upon all things looketh, nor ever escape we his ken</p>
			<p class="i0">Of a surety, such as be god-revering and righteous men.</p>
			<p class="i0">Even so your father delivered he out of the murderous hand</p>
			<p class="i0">Of a stepdame, and gave to him measureless wealth in a far-away land:</p>
			<p class="i0">And even so you also scatheless again did he save</p>
			<p class="i0">From the baleful storm. Now in this ship, whithersoever ye crave,</p>
			<p class="i0">This way or that, may ye fare; or aback unto Aia’s shore,</p>
			<p class="i0">Or the wealthy city that godlike Orchomenus builded of yore.</p>
			<p class="i0">For our ship did Athênê fashion, and clave her beams with the brass</p>
			<p class="i0">By Pelion’s crest, and her fellow-craftsman our Argus was.</p>
			<p class="i0">But that your galley was shattered, and whelmed in ruining surge,</p>
			<p class="i0">Ere nigh to the rocks ye came, the which in the wild sea-gorge</p>
			<p class="i0">Each against other the livelong day are clashing amain.</p>
			<p class="i0">But go to now, be ye helpers with us; for lo, we be fain</p>
			<p class="i0">To bring that Fleece of Gold to the land of Hellas again.</p>
			<p class="i0">Be our voyaging guides. Lo, thus do I sail to atone for their deed</p>
			<p class="i0">Who would sacrifice Phrixus, and brought Zeus’ wrath upon Aiolus’ seed.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake he exhorting, and ceased; but with horror they heard that thing,</p>
			<p class="i0">For they deemed they should find Aiêtes nowise a gentle king</p>
			<p class="i0">Who would win that Fleece of the Ram. Then Argus spake the word,</p>
			<p class="i0">In vexation of spirit that these unto suchlike quest should be stirred:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘O friends, so far as availeth our strength, no whit at all</p>
			<p class="i0">Our help shall fail you at need, what trial soever befall.</p>
			<p class="i0">But terribly armed is Aiêtes with murderous cruelty;</p>
			<p class="i0">Wherefore I dread exceedingly thither to fare oversea.</p>
			<p class="i0">And he vaunteth himself the Sun-god’s seed, and around him dwell</p>
			<p class="i0">The Kolchian tribes untold. In the awful onset-yell,</p>
			<p class="i0">And in giant strength, might he match him with Ares’ self in the fray.</p>
			<p class="i0">Nay, nay, not easy it is to take that Fleece away</p>
			<p class="i0">From Aiêtes, so mighty a serpent around and about it is coiled,</p>
			<p class="i0">Deathless and sleepless. The Earth brought forth that dragon-child</p>
			<p class="i0">Mid Caucasus’ glens, where the Rock Typhonian standeth: they say</p>
			<p class="i0">There Typhon, smitten by levin-bolts of Zeus, in the day</p>
			<p class="i0">When against Kronion he lifted his brawny hands in fight,</p>
			<p class="i0">Dropped from his head hot-gushing the gore, and in such ill plight</p>
			<p class="i0">To the hills and the Plain Nisaian he came, and to this day there</p>
			<p class="i0">’Neath the waters whelmed doth he lie of the dark Serbonian mere.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake he, and many a face of them that heard grew white</p>
			<p class="i0">To know what manner of emprise was this. But spake forthright</p>
			<p class="i0">Peleus, and answered with words of gallant chiding, and said:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Nay, good my friend, not thus let thy spirit be over-adread,</p>
			<p class="i0">For that not so lacking in prowess be we, that our hearts should fear</p>
			<p class="i0">To make trial of manhood against Aiêtes in battle-gear.</p>
			<p class="i0">Nay, but I trow we also have somewhat of cunning in war</p>
			<p class="i0">Which thitherward fare; for by blood of the kin of the Blessèd we are.</p>
			<p class="i0">If therefore in all lovingkindness he yield not the Fleece of Gold,</p>
			<p class="i0">Little, I ween, shall avail him his Kolchian tribes untold.’</p>
			<p class="i1">In such wise each unto other they spake, and in such wise replied,</p>
			<p class="i0">Till they turned to their rest, fulfilled of the feast of the eventide.</p>
			<p class="i0">And at dawn, when they wakened from slumber, a light wind softly blew;</p>
			<p class="i0">And they hoised up the sail: in the breeze of the morning the canvas drew.</p>
			<p class="i0">And away from the War-god’s Island sped they far and fast;</p>
			<p class="i0">And now at the falling of night by Philyra’s island they passed.</p>
			<p class="i0">There Kronos, Ouranos’ son, what time in Olympus he reigned</p>
			<p class="i0">O’er the Titans, and Zeus yet a babe in the Cretan Cave was sustained</p>
			<p class="i0">In life by the priests, the Curêtes of Ida⁠—with Philyra lay</p>
			<p class="i0">When he baffled Rheia’s watch; but the Goddess amidst of their play</p>
			<p class="i0">Came suddenly on them: and Kronos leapt from the dalliance-bed,</p>
			<p class="i0">And away in the form of a steed of tossing mane he sped.</p>
			<p class="i0">But Ocean’s daughter forsook that land and folk in her shame;</p>
			<p class="i0">And unto the long Pelasgian ridges Philyra came,</p>
			<p class="i0">Where Cheiron the monster, the half of him horse, but otherwhere</p>
			<p class="i0">Goodly to see as a God, for a pledge of love she bare.</p>
			<p class="i1">Thence past the Makronian people, and past the far-stretching land</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Becheirans they ran, past overweening Sapeirans’ strand,</p>
			<p class="i0">And past the Byzêrans thereafter; for forward cleaving the seas</p>
			<p class="i0">Went rushing the prow evermore, on-borne by the gentle breeze.</p>
			<p class="i0">And to them, as they sped by, opened a Pontic gulf cleft deep;</p>
			<p class="i0">And lo, the Caucasian mountains’ precipice-wall rose steep⁠—</p>
			<p class="i0">Sheer cliffs; and Prometheus there, with his limbs to the rough rocks gripped</p>
			<p class="i0">By brazen gyves, whose knots no writhings have riven nor slipped,</p>
			<p class="i0">Fed with his liver an eagle that aye swooped back on the prey.</p>
			<p class="i0">High over their mast at even a whir and a rush heard they;</p>
			<p class="i0">And anigh to the clouds they beheld it: yet even from that far height</p>
			<p class="i0">Did it shake the sail with the fanning of those vast pinions’ flight:</p>
			<p class="i0">For the form and the measure thereof was like no fowl of the air,</p>
			<p class="i0">But as polished oars most huge its swift-swaying wing-feathers were.</p>
			<p class="i0">Nor long thereafter they heard an exceeding bitter cry,</p>
			<p class="i0">As torn was Prometheus’ liver, and rang the vault of the sky</p>
			<p class="i0">With his screaming, until again from the mountain darting back</p>
			<p class="i0">They marked where the ravening eagle sped on the selfsame track.</p>
			<p class="i0">And at nightfall, by guidance of Argus, the broad-flowing stream did they gain</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Phasis, and there was the uttermost bourne of the Pontic main.</p>
			<p class="i1">Then straightway the sail they furled, and the yard-arm let they fall,</p>
			<p class="i0">And stowed in the mast-trough then; and the mast unstepped they withal,</p>
			<p class="i0">And lowered in haste, till it lay along: then rowed they fast</p>
			<p class="i0">Into the river’s mighty stream; round the prow as they passed</p>
			<p class="i0">He surged as he yielded them way; and they had on the leftward hand</p>
			<p class="i0">High Caucasus now, and the city Kytaian of Aia-land;</p>
			<p class="i0">And to rightward the plain and the holy grove of the War-god lay</p>
			<p class="i0">Where keepeth the serpent watch and ward on the Fleece alway,</p>
			<p class="i0">As it hangeth amidst of the thick-leaved boughs of an oak outspread.</p>
			<p class="i0">And Aison’s son himself from a golden chalice shed</p>
			<p class="i0">Into the river libations of sweet unmingled wine</p>
			<p class="i0">Unto Earth, to the Gods of the land, to the Spirits of Heroes divine</p>
			<p class="i0">Which had died, and with bowed knees prayed them their sorrowless help to give</p>
			<p class="i0">Of their grace, and with welcome propitious the hawsers of Argo receive.</p>
			<p class="i0">Then straightway Ankaios spake the word to his fellows, and cried:</p>
			<p class="i1">‘Lo now, to the Kolchian land have we won, where the waters glide</p>
			<p class="i0">Of Phasis:⁠—the time is come for counsel, to choose our part,</p>
			<p class="i0">If with soft words now we shall make assay of Aiêtes’ heart,</p>
			<p class="i0">Or if other endeavour perchance shall avail us in this our need.’</p>
			<p class="i1">So spake he, and Jason thereon commanded, by Argus’ rede,</p>
			<p class="i0">To a backwater leaf-overshadowed to run the galley aside,</p>
			<p class="i0">And to warp her up to the anchor-stone, off-shore to ride:</p>
			<p class="i0">Now the place was anigh to them then. So slept they there through the night,</p>
			<p class="i0">And soon to their longing eyes appeared the dawning’s light.</p>
